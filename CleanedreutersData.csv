Africa,/world/africa/,"Survivors in shock as Cyclone Freddy toll passes 300 in Malawi, Mozambique",Tom Gibb,2023-03-16 13:44:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CUQ5A72TE5NXVMXYQO6KLKAHLY.jpg,"BLANTYRE, March 16 (Reuters) - The last thing Lukia Akimu remembers is the surge of floodwater that hit her village near Mount Soche earlier this week when Tropical Cyclone Freddy tore through southern Malawi.
The next thing she knew, she woke up in the hospital, her head wrapped in bandages and her neck in a brace.
""I saw a lot of water and some people being washed away. Then I do not know what happened. I do not know who brought me here,"" said Akimu, 35, from a bed in Queen Elizabeth hospital in the city of Blantyre.
It is not known whether any of her family members survived, a nurse told Reuters.
Tropical Cyclone Freddy has killed more than 300 people in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month, with the toll expected to rise as authorities continue to assess the damage and count the dead in hard-to-reach areas cut off by floods.
The storm has now dissipated, but heavy rains are expected to continue in parts of Malawi and will likely cause more floods around lakeshore areas, said the country's ministry of natural resources and climate change in a statement.

In Mozambique, some villages have been completely cut off since the cyclone made its second landfall on Saturday.
""We mobilised boats and other means to search and rescue people. There are lots of communities stranded,"" said Paulo Tomas, spokesperson for Mozambique's disaster relief agency.
""After this time they are starving and in need of a proper meal and medical assistance,"" he said.
At least 53 people have died in Mozambique and 225 in Malawi since the weekend, according to government figures. The storm had already killed about 27 people in Madagascar and Mozambique before it lashed Mozambique a second time.
Malawi President Lazarus Chakwera visited Queen Elizabeth hospital on Thursday, where he prayed with flood victims. The storm left at least 700 people injured in Malawi at last count.
As rain continued to fall, some had to bury their dead.
In the southern Malawi village of Mtauchira, men stood in newly dug graves that had filled up like pools, scooping the water out with buckets so they could lower in the caskets.
While electricity was starting to come back in Malawi on Thursday, many places affected by the storm still had no running water, including in Blantyre, the second-biggest city.
Some Blantyre residents said they wished they had heeded warnings to flee before the cyclone hit, but they did not understand the gravity and had nowhere to go.
""It was very difficult for people to really understand what was going on prior to this storm. Government sent out the messages but then nothing happened,"" said Blantyre resident Logasiano Misoya. ""I am lucky to be alive.""
Freddy is one of the longest-lasting tropical cyclones ever recorded and one of the deadliest in Africa in recent years.

Africa,/world/africa/,"As Russia looms, US seeks influence in West Africa's fight against Islamists",Cooper Inveen,2023-03-15 21:13:00+00:00,,"DABOYA, Ghana, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. commanders leading annual counter-terrorism exercises in West Africa have urged coastal countries to depend on each other to contain a spreading Islamist insurgency, rather than non-Western powers, after Mali last year hired Russian mercenaries.
Relations between Russia and the U.S. have become more hostile since Moscow invaded Ukraine over a year ago, and Washington and its allies oppose Russian influence in West Africa.
During drills this month in northern Ghana, trainers urged troops to share phone numbers with foreign counterparts operating over poorly marked borders, often just a few miles apart. Elsewhere, soldiers have also learned to use motorbikes, as the insurgents do, for their speed and manoeuvrability.
Overrun by Islamist groups, and amid a row with former colonial power France, Mali's military government last year hired private Russian military contractor Wagner Group, whose fighters are playing key roles in Ukraine, to combat the militants. This has worried Western governments and the United Nations who say the move has led to a spike in violence.

Mali, whose government took power in a 2021 military coup, has previously said Russian forces are not mercenaries but trainers helping local troops with equipment from Russia.
""You have governments with so many problems that they begin reaching out to other malign actors who are perhaps more exploitive of the resources in those countries,"" Colonel Robert Zyla from U.S. Special Operations Command Africa (SOCAF) told Reuters at exercises in Ghana.
""Contrast that with what we’re trying to bring, which are partnerships between neighbours and other democratic nations.""
In this month's exercises, soldiers patrolled barren scrubland dotted with thin bushes. At the centre of the strategy is engaging border communities and making sure armies work together in a region where frontiers span hundreds of miles of sparsely populated desert.
""No one country can solve this by themselves,"" Zyla said. ""Going forward it will be about teaching countries in the region how to reach across borders and talk.""

For a decade, offensive efforts have failed to stop an Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands and displaced millions. Security experts say it could get worse after thousands of French troops were forced out of Mali and Burkina Faso by military juntas this year.
The main challenge is a lack of resources and large-scale international commitment to defence in one of the poorest parts of the world, experts said.
Ghana has bolstered troops in its northern regions. But it has no reconnaissance drones to monitor border areas, said Colonel Richard Kainyi Mensah, chief operations officer for Ghana's special operations brigade.
""Logistics and equipment are key,"" he said. ""Resources are limited.""
It is not clear what more resources the U.S. and Europe are willing to give. The U.S. has been reluctant to engage after four soldiers were killed in Niger in 2017. The UK, Germany and other nations are pulling troops from a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mali as security worsens.
Earlier this month, General Michael Langley, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, told journalists that ""stabilization and security"" were its focus in Africa, without providing details.
Some believe that not enough is being done.
""There’s a lot of hesitancy to deploy more than we need to,"" said Aneliese Bernard, director of Strategic Stabilization Advisors, a U.S.-based risk advisory group. ""The irony is that means we're basically putting a Band-Aid on a severed limb.""
Timing is crucial, security experts and military officials said. Islamist violence that began in 2012 in Mali has spread. Armed groups have a foothold in coastal countries including Benin and Togo and threaten economic leaders Ivory Coast and Ghana.

Africa,/world/africa/,"Blinken praises Ethiopia on Tigray peace, no return to trade programme yet",Daphne Psaledakis,2023-03-15 21:04:00+00:00,,"ADDIS ABABA, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised Ethiopia on Wednesday for its progress in implementing a peace deal to end the Tigray conflict, but stopped short of ushering the country back into a U.S. trade programme.
Visiting Ethiopia to repair relations that were strained by the two-year war in the northern region, Blinken met with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and discussed ongoing efforts to solidify peace, restore basic services and address humanitarian needs.
The Ethiopian government and forces from Tigray signed a ceasefire in November, ending a conflict that killed tens of thousands of people, left hundreds of thousands facing hunger and displaced millions.
The U.S. government restricted economic and security assistance to Ethiopia during the war and cut access to the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a duty-free trade programme that had been a boon for the country's textile sector.
View 2 more stories 
""Certainly we share the aspiration of Ethiopia returning to AGOA,"" Blinken told reporters after his meetings with Abiy and other government figures, adding that ""it's moving in the right direction"" as Ethiopia continues to implement the peace accord.
He said Ethiopia had been given clear benchmarks and Washington would continue to work with the government in Addis to achieve the goal.
""We have agreed to strengthen the long-standing bilateral relations between our countries with a commitment to partnership,"" Abiy said on Twitter after the meeting.
Blinken also met on Wednesday with Ethiopia's National Security Advisor Redwan Hussein and the spokesperson of the rebellious forces of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), Getachew Reda, the State Department said. The parties acknowledged the progress but agreed ""much work remains to fully implement"" the ceasefire agreement.
The two sides also discussed the need for the establishment of a Tigrayan interim administration as key to maintaining positive momentum, the statement said.
During a visit to a United Nations logistics warehouse, Blinken announced $331 million in new humanitarian aid to Ethiopia, saying this would provide life-saving support for people affected by conflict, drought and food insecurity.
His visit is the latest in a series to Africa by senior Biden administration officials as Washington looks to reinforce ties with a continent where China's diplomatic and economic influence is ubiquitous.
On Thursday, he will head to the West African nation of Niger, which has been confronting a growing Islamist insurgency.
The United States was outspoken in its criticism of alleged atrocities by Ethiopian forces and their allies from Eritrea and the Amhara region during the Tigray war.
Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous nation and traditionally a U.S. ally in East Africa, accused Washington of meddling in its internal affairs and threatened to reassess the bilateral relationship.
It has denied the most serious allegations of human rights violations during the war.
Blinken and Abiy discussed ""the importance of accountability for the atrocities perpetrated by all parties during the conflict, as well as the need for an inclusive and comprehensive process of transitional justice,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said.
As well as mending ties with allies, Ethiopia is also looking to restructure its debt and secure an International Monetary Fund loan, which the state finance minister said last year was being delayed in part by the Tigray war.
While the peace deal has allowed humanitarian aid to flow into Tigray, needs remain immense.
Allegation of abuses, especially sexual violence, have persisted after the deal was signed, though Blinken said human rights advocates had told him during his meeting with them on Wednesday that there had been a significant drop.
""We strongly urge all parties ... to do everything possible to ensure that they cease entirely,"" he said.
Eritrean troops remain in several border areas while militia from the Amhara region, which neighbours Tigray, occupy large areas of territory in contested parts of western and southern Tigray, humanitarian workers say.
Asked by reporters about the Eritrean troops, Blinken said they were departing, but the process was not complete.
Eritrea's government spokesperson has not responded to requests for comment about the actions of Eritrean troops or any other aspect of its policies.
A spokesperson for the Amhara regional government said it and the people of Amhara were ""always ready to co-operate with peace deal process and activities"".

Africa,/world/africa/,Blinken brings aid and praise to Niger as it battles insurgents,Reuters,2023-03-16 12:20:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/W6LIFGAXFZM6JBDODWWV6DRL44.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will announce new humanitarian aid on Thursday during a visit to Niger, a country in West Africa's Sahel region that Washington wants to support as it grapples with Islamist insurgencies.
Blinken's visit to Niger, the first by a U.S. Secretary of State, signals its importance as a U.S. ally in the Sahel, a senior State Department official told reporters travelling with Blinken.
""They're making the right choices, we think, to help deal with the kind of threats that are common across the Sahel. So, we're trying to highlight a positive example,"" the official said.
Landlocked Niger and other countries in the Sahel, including its neighbours Mali, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Chad, are all struggling to repel Islamist insurgents who in some cases have seized control of swathes of territory.

The official praised Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum for opposing military coups in Mali and Burkina Faso and for consulting the parliament over security issues rather than deciding alone.
The official also praised Bazoum for speaking out against Russia's Wagner group, which has been hired by Mali's junta to help fight insurgents there. Mali describes the Wagner personnel on its territory as ""trainers"".
A French-led international force has been on the ground in Mali for a decade but has fallen out of favour with Mali's leadership. Anti-French sentiment has been on the rise in Mali and several other former French colonies in West Africa.
Ghana has asserted that Burkina Faso has also hired Wagner mercenaries. Burkina Faso's junta has neither confirmed nor denied that.
""I think it's quite interesting that Wagner is most active in francophone Africa. I believe they're trying to capitalise on anti-French sentiment,"" the State Department official said.
""They use a lot of misinformation and disinformation to besmirch the French, I think, and the traditional French security partnership.""
The official said the United States had a positive image in the region and we were not seen in the way the French were.
""The Russians are not, the Wagner Group are not a good partner,"" the official added.
Blinken was travelling to Niger from Ethiopia, where he met on Wednesday with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and other government figures in an effort to repair the diplomatic damage caused by the two-year war in Tigray that ended in November.
His trip is the latest in a series of visits to Africa by senior figures from President Joe Biden's administration, which is seeking to reinforce ties with a continent where China's diplomatic and economic influence is ubiquitous and some countries maintain cordial relations with Russia.

Africa,/world/africa/,Senegal rocked by more unrest as police clash with opposition protesters,Bate Felix,2023-03-16 13:30:00+00:00,,"DAKAR, March 16 (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas at stone-hurling protesters during street clashes in Senegal's capital on Thursday, ahead of a court case involving a prominent opposition politician that has triggered widespread anger among the West African country's youth.
Demonstrators in Dakar burned tyres and set fire to buses and a large supermarket, the latest in a series of outbreaks of violence that have shaken Senegal's reputation as a bastion of stable democracy, just months ahead of a presidential election.
Thursday's clashes began when supporters of presidential hopeful Ousmane Sonko were blocked from accompanying his motorcade to the courthouse where he faces trial for libel.
Sonko, 48, who came third in the 2019 presidential election, is also charged with raping a beauty salon employee in 2021 and making deaths threats against her. He denies all wrongdoing and says the accusations are politically motivated to stop him running in the February 2024 polls.
View 2 more stories 
Much of the anger on the street is targeted towards President Macky Sall, whose failure to rule out running for a third term in office has incensed many.
Senegal's constitution only allows two terms, but some fear that Sall will use a recent tweak to the constitution to reset his mandate, repeating a tactic used by other rulers to extend power elsewhere in the region.
""We elected Macky Sall to work, not to establish a dictatorship. He must leave Sonko alone, if he does not leave him alone we will burn the country,"" a Sonko supporter said.
Tensions have flared ahead of Sonko's court appearance this week, with three days of protest. More than 10,000 supporters gathered at a field in Dakar on Tuesday to cheer on Sonko.
The former tax inspector urged his supporters to join him in court on Thursday for the hearing. But his convoy and supporters were stopped along a main road by police.
Sonko was forced out of his car and bundled into a police armoured personnel carrier and driven to court, triggering the clashes.
Sonko supporters accuse Sall of seeking to eliminate him from the competition with a guilty verdict.
The libel case was brought by Senegal's tourism minister who said Sonko had allegedly accused him of embezzlement.

Africa,/world/africa/,Tunisia arrests another union leader - UGTT,Tarek Amara,2023-03-16 10:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/26RKVVALGNLBZHJLLTYFPAWSWY.jpg,"TUNIS, March 16 (Reuters) - Tunisian police arrested an official in the powerful UGTT union on suspicion of insulting a minister, a union official said on Thursday, the second such recent detention in an escalating confrontation between the labour body and President Kais Saied.
The UGTT has lately been at the forefront of protests against Saied, who seized wide-ranging powers in 2021 and has been cracking down on political opponents.
A union official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that its general secretary for culture, Abdel Nasser Ben Amara, was arrested on Wednesday after a protest at the Culture Ministry on Monday. He gave no more details.
Government officials were unavailable for comment.
The UGTT was initially slow to criticize Saied after what opponents call his ""coup"" in 2021. But as the president consolidated his grip while sidelining the union and other players, it began to openly challenge him.

Critics say Saied has dismantled the democracy and freedoms won in a 2011 revolution that triggered the Arab Spring.
He counters that he is saving Tunisia from chaos.
Another senior union official was detained last month for organizing a strike by highway tollbooth operators, prompting the UGTT's newspaper to accuse Saied of declaring war on the organization and its 1 million members.
The UGTT has been holding rallies around Tunisia since last month after weeks of arrests in the biggest crackdown since Saied began ruling by decree in 2021.
Police have detained more than a dozen prominent opposition figures, accusing them of conspiring against state security.

Uganda's opposition has long accused Museveni of seeking to impose a monarchy on Uganda and claimed he was grooming his son Muhoozi Kainerugaba to take over from him. Museveni has denied such accusations.
Currently a special presidential advisor for special operations, the 48 year-old general is known for firing off controversial tweets that have earned him reprimands from his father.
Kainerugaba quickly deleted the messages about his presidential aspirations, which he had posted to Twitter late on Wednesday.
""You have wanted me to say it forever! Okay, in the name of Jesus Christ my God, in the name of all the young people of Uganda and the world and in the name of our great revolution, I will stand for the Presidency in 2026,"" Kainerugaba wrote.

In another tweet, he expressed his impatience at waiting so long to replace his father.
""The Prime Minister of UK is 42 years old, the Prime Minister of Finland is 37 years. Some of us are hitting 50 years old. We are tired of waiting forever,"" he said.
Kainerugaba previously served as commander of land forces but was removed from that position after threatening to invade neighbouring Kenya, which he later said was a joke.
Museveni not yet said whether he intends to stand again in 2026, although his supporters have encouraged him to do so.

Africa,/world/africa/,"Gold Fields, AngloGold rule out merger after Ghana joint-venture deal",Nelson Banya,2023-03-16 11:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BAHHITP7UFOL5GJS7YTQBZ7KNE.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - Gold Fields (GFIJ.J) and AngloGold Ashanti (ANGJ.J) are not considering a full-scale merger after they agreed to combine their neighbouring Tarkwa and Iduapriem mines in Ghana to create Africa's biggest gold mine, the two companies said on Thursday.
Gold miners are increasingly looking to consolidate as they seek to replace depleting reserves and contain cost pressures.
Last month, U.S.-based Newmont Corp (NEM.N), the world's top gold producer, bid $16.9 billion for Australia's Newcrest Mining (NCM.AX), triggering speculation of a new wave of mergers and acquisitions in the industry.
When asked by reporters if a merger was under consideration, AngloGold CEO Alberto Calderon said: ""We are in similar places around the world, but for now this is the thing we are focused on. We’re not going to entertain any speculation on that (a merger). There’s no conversation or anything of that sort.""
Calderon and Gold Fields interim CEO Martin Preece said on a conference call about their joint venture that they would explore other opportunities to maximise synergies where they arise.
View 2 more stories 
The South Africa-headquartered AngloGold and Gold Fields are among the five biggest gold producing companies by output in the world, with operations in Africa, Australia and South America.
Calderon has previously said AngloGold prefers internal growth to acquisitions.
Gold Fields' Preece, who last month said the company was no longer pursuing big M&A deals after its failed bid for Canada's Yamana Gold (YRI.TO) said on the conference call ""collaboration is easier"".
""I think it’s going to be asset-specific and opportunity-specific,"" Preece said.
Gold Fields and AngloGold would own 60% and 30% of the joint operation, respectively, with the Ghanaian government holding 10%, Calderon said.
The joint venture would produce an average 900,000 ounces annually over the first five years and 600,000 ounces over its estimated 18-year life of the mine, the companies said.
""The proposed joint venture would create the largest gold mine in Africa and one of the largest in the world. It will be a high-quality operation, supported by a substantial mineral
endowment and an initial life spanning almost two decades,"" the companies said in a joint statement.
The combined operation's all-in sustaining costs (AISC), an industry measure, would be less than $1,000 per ounce for the first five years and less than $1,200 per ounce over the estimated life of mine.
Tarkwa produced 531,600 ounces in 2022 at AISC of $1,248 per ounce, while Iduapriem produced 248,000 ounces at a cost of $1,299 per ounce.
Apart from Tarkwa, Gold Fields has two other mines in Ghana, Damang and the 45%-owned Asanko. AngloGold also has another mine in Ghana, Obuasi, in addition to Iduapriem.

At 0645 GMT, the rand traded at 18.4075 against the dollar , little changed from its previous close of 18.4175.
The local currency ended about 1.6% lower against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, shrugging off a smaller-than-expected contraction in local retail sales in January.
No major South African economic data releases are due on Thursday.
Recent data have pointed to ongoing weakness in Africa's most industrialised economy, after a bigger-than-forecast fall in the fourth-quarter gross domestic product.
Severe power constraints are hurting businesses of all sizes, leading the central bank to expect almost no economic growth this year.
South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was also broadly flat in early deals, with the yield at 10.040%.

Africa,/world/africa/,Malawi buries cyclone victims as death toll rises further,Frank Phiri,2023-03-15 23:09:00+00:00,,"BLANTYRE/MAPUTO, March 15 (Reuters) - Malawian families gathered on Wednesday to remember and bury the victims of Tropical Cyclone Freddy, with President Lazarus Chakwera calling on the international community for support as the toll rose further.
Freddy tore through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend and was still causing heavy rain on Wednesday, hampering relief efforts.
""I am personally so devastated,"" Chakwera told reporters in Chilobwe township's Naotcha, on the outskirts of Blantyre. ""Sometimes when you just pass by these many caskets, you cannot help but shed tears because, loved ones, one whole family completely wiped out and so many others that have been touched.""
Malawi's disaster management department said in a statement that the death toll from the storm's second hit had risen to 225, from 190, with 707 people injured and 41 missing.
""We are using hope as our currency to encourage those that have survived that we will not leave them alone because we are trusting you, as our international neighbours to come through so Malawians can continue with that hope,"" the president said, adding that survivors needed clothing, food and shelter.

The UN Refugee Agency said in a statement that it was deeply concerned by the devastation and impact of the Tropical Cyclone Freddy which affected over 16,000 people across 10 districts in Malawi’s southern region.
In neighbouring Mozambique, at least 21 people had died as of Tuesday, according to the disaster agency.
The overall death toll since Freddy first made landfall in February is now estimated at more than 270 in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar.
Malawi's army, police, the local Red Cross and other aid agencies were conducting search and rescue operations, with commercial hub Blantyre one of the areas hardest-hit.
Severe flooding and mudslides have swept away homes, broken bridges and destroyed roads. Heavy rain has continued to batter the Mozambican port of Quelimane and surrounding areas.
""Our priority now, as we take stock to what really occurred, is to search and rescue people in most devastated areas. We've rescued thousands but thousands more are still unreachable,"" said disaster agency spokesperson Paulo Tomas by telephone from Quelimane.

In neighbouring Mozambique, at least 21 people had died as of Tuesday, according to the disaster agency.
The overall death toll since Freddy first made landfall in February is now estimated at more than 270 in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar.
Malawi's army, police, the local Red Cross and other aid agencies were conducting search and rescue operations, with commercial hub Blantyre one of the areas hardest-hit.
Severe flooding and mudslides have swept away homes, broken bridges and destroyed roads. Heavy rain has continued to batter the Mozambican port of Quelimane and surrounding areas.
""Our priority now, as we take stock to what really occurred, is to search and rescue people in most devastated areas. We've rescued thousands but thousands more are still unreachable,"" said disaster agency spokesperson Paulo Tomas by telephone from Quelimane.

Africa,/world/africa/,S.Africa's Exxaro Resources says coal prices cooling off,Nelson Banya,2023-03-16 09:50:00+00:00,,"March 16 (Reuters) - South Africa's Exxaro Resources (EXXJ.J) on Thursday posted a 28% jump in 2022 profit after seeing average coal prices surge more than 150%, but warned prices were easing, partly due to high inventories at European power utilities.
Exxaro posted a 41% increase in revenue to 46.4 billion rand ($2.53 billion). It realised an average coal price of $251 per tonne last year, up from $96 in 2021, due to a price surge after the European Union banned coal imports from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
However prices, which started coming off in the final quarter of 2022 due to the European inventories amid milder winter temperatures in October and November, have continued to decline in the new year, Exxaro's finance director Riaan Koppeschaar told Reuters.
""We should expect a bit of a discount on the API4 side because of the weakness in the Atlantic basin. If you look at the forecasts, it’s somewhere between $120 and $140 per tonne,"" Koppeschaar said. API4 is the benchmark price reference for South African coal exports.

Like its peers, Exxaro has been trucking some of its coal to ports due to rail capacity problems at South Africa's state-owned Transnet.
Transnet is struggling to haul minerals to port due to the shortage of locomotives and spares as well as cable theft and vandalism of its infrastructure, forcing exporters to resort to rail.
But coal volumes moved by trucks, an expensive alternative to rail, are declining due to weaker prices, Koppeschaar said.
""There is very little coal being shipped from the trucking route in Richards Bay, so it’s clear there's already a material chunk (of coal) that’s not economical,"" he said.
Exxaro exported 5.2 million tonnes in 2022, down from 7.6 million tonnes the previous year due to the rail capacity problems.
The miner reported a 28% jump in headline earnings per share to 60.16 rand ($3.27) in the year ended Dec. 31, compared with 46.83 rand previously, but declared a lower dividend, citing lower income from its iron ore investment as well as uncertainty over rail performance.
It declared a final dividend of 11.36 rand per share, compared with 11.75 rand last year.

Africa,/world/africa/,U.S. military conducts first maritime drills with West African forces,Cooper Inveen,2023-03-16 06:19:00+00:00,,"SOGAKOPE, Ghana, March 16 (Reuters) - The West African troops silently pulled their small boats up to a rust-stained ferry and swarmed up its sides on grappling hooks to disarm the mock kidnappers onboard.
The drill in Ghana's Volta river on Saturday was carried out during the first ever maritime exercises organised by the U.S. military under its long-running Flintlock programme to bolster the skills of West African forces.
The sea-based training in the first half of March culminated with soldiers holding their guns aloft as they braved neck-high waves before storming a beach resort to defuse a staged hostage crisis. Military bigwigs and diplomats watched from nearby.
Admiral Milton Sands, commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command for Africa (SOCAF), said the programme had expanded to help coastal nations in the region cope with maritime threats such as piracy and illegal fishing.
Unauthorised fishing ""is a significant one that we're really trying to work with our partners to get our arms around slowing down,"" he told Reuters on Tuesday.
He said illegal fishing not only robbed the region of a key food source, but fuelled other criminal activity including drugs and human trafficking.

Around 350 troops took part in the drills including servicemen from Ivory Coast, Ghana and Nigeria on the Gulf of Guinea. The area has become a global piracy hotspot in recent years although cases have fallen there since 2021, according to the U.N. Security Council.
Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing has spread along West Africa's coasts, sapping an estimated $9.4 billion per year through illicit financial flows, according to a 2022 report by the Financial Transparency Coalition of non-governmental organisations.
Of the top 10 companies they found involved in IUU fishing in the region, eight were Chinese and a third of all vessels sported Chinese flags, it said.
Commodore Godwin Livinus Bessing, commander of Ghana's Naval Training Command, said tackling IUU fishing had become a top priority, citing a lack of resources to deal with the foreign boats stealing from Ghana's waters.
""They continue to flout our regulations because of our enforcement capabilities,"" he said. ""That is one of the biggest problems. If we had enough ships out there and they knew we were monitoring the place, we would be able to curb the situation.""

A U.S. judge in September dismissed the $10 billion lawsuit seeking to hold U.S. gun makers responsible for facilitating the trafficking of deadly weapons across the border.
""A favorable decision in the court of appeals will allow the government to prove its case on the merits - that the gun manufacturers' marketing and distribution practices amount to actively facilitating the trafficking of their guns into Mexico,"" the government said in a statement.
""There is a correlation between the negligent practices of companies and the arms trafficking that leads to violence in Mexico, as well as other crimes such as human trafficking and drug trafficking, particularly of fentanyl,"" it added.
The issue of gun violence in Mexico has drawn new scrutiny on both sides of the border in recent days following the cartel-linked kidnapping of four Americans in the northern state of Tamaulipas, during which two of them and a Mexican bystander were killed.

The Mexican government's appeal is targeting Smith and Wesson Brands Inc (SWBI.O) and Sturm, Ruger and Co (RGR.N), as well as Barrett Firearms Manufacturing Inc, Beretta USA Corp, Colt's Manufacturing Co, Century International Arms Inc, Witmer Public Safety Group Inc and pistol-maker Glock Inc.
Reuters contacted all of the companies but none immediately responded to a request for comment.
Mexico is not the only country in the region to be plagued by gun violence.
Caribbean leaders at a summit last month discussed tighter measures to stop U.S.-made weapons from being trafficked to Haiti where gangs are fueling a humanitarian crisis.
According to a United Nations assessment early March, a surge in trafficking of increasingly sophisticated and high-caliber firearms and ammunition to Haiti concealed in shipments from Florida is fuelling mass displacements and levels of gang violence not seen in decades.

Lopez Obrador has vigorously rejected such suggestions, and argues his government is reducing the threat posed by the drug, saying it has seized more illegal fentanyl than ""ever before.""
During a regular news conference, he said he would ask medical experts to analyze the possibility of ""substituting fentanyl for medical uses with other painkillers.""
""If we do it in Mexico, we'll ask them to do it in the United States, so they also prohibit it for medical ends,"" he added, criticizing the effectiveness of U.S. anti-drugs policy and saying Mexico would not play a subordinate role to the U.S.

Lasso has denied corruption allegations and said his government will fully cooperate with ongoing investigations by the attorney general into alleged graft at state companies.

""They are looking for ways to tie this soap opera to a reason to remove President Lasso,"" he said.
Opposition politicians were unperturbed.
""The only truth is that we have a drug trafficking government that is protecting mobsters and which allowed a criminal structure to install itself in public companies,"" said lawmaker Viviana Veloz, a member of the political party of former President Rafael Correa.

Impeachment hearings, which need the votes of 92 legislators to proceed, could result in the censure or removal of Lasso, who has served for nearly two years.
The legislature has also voted to declassify presidential visitors logs, which are being digitized and are not yet public.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,North Korea launches ICBM ahead of South Korea-Japan summit,Josh Smith,2023-03-16 10:27:00+00:00,,"SEOUL, March 16 (Reuters) - North Korea fired a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan on Thursday, hours before South Korea's president flew to Tokyo for a summit that discussed ways to counter the nuclear-armed North.
North Korea has conducted multiple missile launches this week amid ongoing joint South Korea-U.S. military drills that Pyongyang condemns as hostile actions.
The missile, fired at 7:10 a.m. (2210 GMT on Wednesday) from Pyongyang, flew about 1,000 kilometres at a lofted trajectory, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said.
Japan's defence ministry said the ICBM-type projectile appeared to have flown higher than 6,000 km for about 70 minutes.
It most likely landed outside Japan's exclusive economic zones, 200 km west of Oshima-Oshima Island in Hokkaido, northern Japan, the ministry said.

The ministry released video footage shot by the crew of a Japanese F-15 fighter jet of what it believed was flaming debris from the missile falling through the sky.
Japan has not confirmed any information on damage from the missile, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said, adding it had delivered a protest through North Korea's embassy in Beijing.
""North Korea's missile launch is a barbaric act that escalates its provocation to the entire international society,"" Matsuno said. ""We will confirm close cooperation with South Korea and the U.S. towards North Korea's complete denuclearisation at the Japan-South Korea summit today.""
South Korea convened a national security council meeting and ""strongly condemned"" the missile launch as a grave act of provocation threatening international peace.
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered his country's military to carry out drills with the United States as planned, saying North Korea would pay for its ""reckless provocations,"" according to his office.
South Korean and American forces began 11 days of joint drills, dubbed ""Freedom Shield 23,"" on Monday, held on a scale not seen since 2017 to counter the North's growing threats.
Speaking at the Geneva based Conference on Disarmament on Thursday, North Korean ambassador to the United Nations Han Tae Song said recent launch exercises by the North were countermeasures against threats to its security.
The joint U.S.-South Korea drills are an ""extremely dangerous provocative military action"" that could drive the situation into an ""uncontrolled and unpredictable crisis,"" he said.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said after the launch that regional peace and stability were the most important issue, and White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the United States ""strongly condemns"" North Korea's latest launch for needlessly raising tensions in the region.
U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has assessed the missile did not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to its allies.
Thursday's launch came as Yoon was headed to Japan for the first such summit with Kishida in more than a decade, part of an effort to overcome historical, political and economic disputes in the name of better cooperating to counter North Korea and other challenges.
As part of the efforts, the two U.S. allies have agreed to share real-time tracking of North Korean missile launches, and have vowed to further deepen military cooperation.
""Today's missile launch is an apparent protest not only to the South Korea-U.S. drills but also to South Korea and Japan moving to step up their military cooperation,"" said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute.
""But such a protest will only push the Yoon government to further strengthen cooperation with Japan, and trilaterally with the United States, and have a boomerang effect,"" he added.
It was not immediately clear what type of ICBM was launched on Thursday, but a South Korean military official said that the missile appeared similar to the Hwasong-17 - a liquid-fuel missile North Korea has tested before - and that it was unlikely to be a new solid-fuel ICBM.
The Hwasong-17 is the North's biggest missile, and is the largest road-mobile, liquid-fuelled ICBM in the world, believed to be capable of delivering a nuclear warhead anywhere in the United States.
Some analysts have speculated it could carry multiple warheads and decoys to better penetrate missile defences.
North Korea's ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes are banned under U.N. Security Council resolutions, but Pyongyang says weapons development is necessary to counter ""hostile policies"" by Washington and its allies.
North Korea's state news agency KCNA said on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un led a ruling party meeting to discuss and decide on ""important practical"" war deterrence measures, saying ""provocations of the U.S. and South Korea are reaching the red-line.""

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Pakistan court postpones police operation to arrest Imran Khan,Mubasher Bukhari,2023-03-16 12:28:00+00:00,,"LAHORE, Pakistan, March 16 (Reuters) - A Pakistani high court ordered police on Thursday to postpone an operation to arrest Imran Khan for another day, defusing a surge in violence that saw supporters of the former prime minister fighting pitched battles with security forces.
Khan's aide Fawad Chaudhry said the Lahore high court had extended an order to halt the police operation until Friday. The state information minister, Amir Mir, confirmed the court order.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, dozens of Khan's supporters, armed with batons and sling-shots, barricaded his home to prevent security forces from arresting him for failing to show up in court over a case in which he is charged with illegally selling state gifts given to him while he was prime minister. Khan denies the charges.
The court-ordered attempt to arrest Khan, which began on Tuesday, triggered clashes between his supporters and security forces in his Lahore neighbourhood, raising fears about the political stability of nuclear-armed Pakistan as it faces an economic crisis.

The violence, in which protesters torched police vehicles, a water-cannon truck and scores of cars and motorcycles and hurled petrol bombs at security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets, subsided after the high court halted the police operation on Wednesday.
A lower court in Islamabad had issued a warrant against former international cricketer Khan for defying orders to present himself in court over charges that he unlawfully sold state gifts given to him by foreign dignitaries when he was prime minister from 2018 to 2022.
Khan's legal team on Thursday filed an appeal in the trial court, pleading for the suspension of the arrest warrants, which was turned down, said three local TV channels.
Khan denies the charges. The National Election Commission had found him guilty and barred Khan from holding public office for one parliamentary term.
The legal proceedings against Khan began after he was ousted from office in a parliamentary vote early last year.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,South Koreans sceptical as president offers olive branch to Japan,Ju-min Park,2023-03-16 04:26:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VNR3KT37RFPUVDP3STPZQJ35FQ.jpg,"SEOUL, March 16 (Reuters) - As South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol landed in Tokyo on Thursday his plan to patch up relations with Japan faces lingering scepticism at home.
South Korean opposition likely poses little domestic political problem for the conservative Yoon, but could affect how far he is able to go in winning cooperation from Japan, experts said.
Yoon's visit to Tokyo - the first such summit since 2011 - comes after he proposed that South Korean companies compensate plaintiffs who won court cases accusing Japanese firms of using forced labour during Japan's 1910-1945 occupation of Korea.
That plan was welcomed in Tokyo and praised by the White House as ""ground breaking,"" but several key victims have already rejected the proposal, and polls show it is generally unpopular in South Korea.
About 59% of the respondents oppose the plan because of the lack of an apology and compensation from Japan; 64% do not consider Yoon’s proposed compensation plan adequate, a Gallup Korea survey showed. Sixty-four percent of the respondents said South Korea did not need to rush to improve ties with Japan if there were no change in Tokyo's attitude, according to the poll.

""I believe that the Korean people will understand how hard the government has worked to heal the wound of the forced labour victims and to build a future-oriented Korea-Japan relations,"" Yoon said in a written interview with international media on Wednesday, when asked about domestic opposition.
The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) on Monday unilaterally passed a resolution through the parliamentary foreign affairs committee urging Yoon to withdraw the plan. Lawmakers from Yoon's People Power Party (PPP) boycotted the committee meeting.
The government's human-rights body said the proposal is not appropriate for the victims by international standards.
""Since the issue of compensation for victims of forced labour is an important issue for restoring human dignity, all countermeasures must consider the emotional and psychological damage suffered by the victims,"" Song Doo-hwan, chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission, said in a statement last week.
That lack of public support at home affects his ability to win concessions from the Japanese, who are wary of making deals that – as with the 2015 agreement over South Korean women and girls forced to work in Japanese wartime brothels – could be swept away by a change of administrations in Seoul, analysts said.
""The last remaining hurdle is resistance from our people,"" said Kim Joon-hyung, a former chancellor of the Korean National Diplomatic Academy.
Yoon is the latest of many South Korean conservatives who embrace the argument that Seoul must heal divides with Japan to confront security challenges. His administration also seems to be calculating that North Korea's increased missile launches will give them the domestic political cover to push forward with reconciliation, Kim said.
Just hours before Yoon departed for Japan, North Korea test-fired an apparent intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into the sea.
For now, the Japanese public welcome the deal, polls showed. A Kyodo poll said on Monday that 57% of Japanese supported South Korea’s proposal to resolve the wartime labour dispute, while 33% did not. Kishida’s ratings rose to 38%, 4.5 percentage points up from mid-February, according to the poll.
""There's a lot of debate domestically, but Yoon has taken a step forward. Reports from Seoul say Yoon won't use Japan relations for political purposes,"" a Japanese government source with the knowledge of the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Boycotts of Japanese products and vacations have largely faded in South Korea, and a growing number of South Koreans are travelling to Japan as COVID restrictions ease.
Three Japanese animated films are among the top five at box office in South Korea.
Studies have shown that although South Koreans enjoy Japanese movies and food, however, South Korea's growing stature in the world has made younger citizens less willing than older generations to sweep historical disputes under the rug in the name of closer ties.
""Separate from me liking Japanese culture, we don't need to be submissive to Japan in diplomacy,"" said Kim Joo-hee, 30, an office worker in Seoul who travels to Japan for her year-end holidays. ""So I don't like everything coming out of news these days.""

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Australia PM defends AUKUS submarine deal against critics,Lewis Jackson,2023-03-16 03:36:00+00:00,,"SYDNEY, March 16 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday defended the country's A$368 billion ($244.06 billion) plan to acquire nuclear submarines, after two former leaders criticised the deal over its cost, complexity and potential sovereignty issues.
Unveiled on Tuesday in San Diego, the multi-decade AUKUS project will see Australia purchase U.S. Virginia-class submarines before joint British and Australian production and operation of a new submarine class, SSN-AUKUS.
After criticism from Malcolm Turnbull and Paul Keating, both former prime ministers, Albanese said that the deal was necessary given the buildup of Chinese military power in the region, which he called the largest since World War Two.
""China has changed its posture and its positioning in world affairs since the 1990s... that's the truth of the matter,"" he said.
Turnbull said on Thursday that the AUKUS project would take longer and cost more than an alternative plan to buy conventional French submarines, ""recklessly"" scrapped in 2021.

""We've been caught up in this hoopla where anyone who expresses any concerns about it is accused of being or implied they are lacking in patriotism,"" Turnbull said.
Paul Keating, a former Prime Minister under the ruling Labor Party, on Wednesday called AUKUS the worst foreign policy mistake by the party since a failed bid to introduce conscription in World War One.
Buttressed by bipartisan support in Parliament, criticism of the security pact has been mostly confined to academics, former politicians and minor parties.
Opting for nuclear submarines in the U.S.-Britain alliance over conventional alternatives would leave Australia with fewer submarines while constraining the country's ability to operate independently of the United States, he said.
""Anthony Albanese screwed into place the last shackle in the long chain the United States has laid out to contain China,"" he said.
Some analysts have argued nuclear submarines are preferable because their superior range and stealth will help protect Australia's trade routes from Chinese aggression.

He was speaking after meeting visiting Indonesian President Joko Widodo.
Lee said the leaders regretted the lack of progress on a peace plan led by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Myanmar, which has been gripped by violence and unrest since a coup in February 2021 that upended a decade of democratic reforms.
""Singapore will continue working with Indonesia and ASEAN members, plus ASEAN's partners like the U.N., to push for the full implementation of the five-point consensus,"" he said, referring to the peace plan that Myanmar's top general agreed to with ASEAN.
Indonesia currently chairs the 10-member ASEAN bloc.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,"'Omurice', comfort food for Japanese and Koreans, a symbol of warmer ties",Kantaro Komiya,2023-03-16 06:29:00+00:00,,"TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Nearly everything about South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's first summit with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo will be scrutinised for signs of warmer bilateral ties, including a shared meal of a Tokyo classic called omurice.
The dish, whose name is a mash-up of omelette and rice, has become the talk of the town since Japan's Fuji TV reported on Monday of a hushed plan for Kishida to treat Yoon at Rengatei, the storied but no-frills restaurant that invented it.
Yoon, a self-described foodie and avid cook, reportedly had ""unforgettable"" memories of the omurice he ate in his youth at the 128-year-old establishment in Tokyo's Ginza district. He made frequent trips to the Japanese capital in 1966 while his father, a university professor, spent a year there, he told the Yomiuri daily.
Japanese and South Korean officials have declined to confirm the plan or venue, while Rengatei, famed as the birthplace of omurice in 1900, declined to comment.

Although many foreigners might associate Japanese cuisine with sushi or tempura, ""yoshoku"", or Western-influenced dishes such as omurice and tonkatsu (deep-fried pork cutlet), are more common fare on Japanese dinner tables.
Yoshoku is a genre of Japanese cuisine established more than a century ago, and some made its way to South Korea in the 1960s as ethnic Koreans travelled between the two countries, said Motoo Kawabata, a professor at Kwansei Gakuin University who specialises in Japanese restaurants' global strategy.
Kishida and Yoon will reportedly share a more formal dinner of sukiyaki beforehand, but the real ice-breaker could be when they sit down for omurice, Kawabata said. Japan and South Korea are holding a summit for the first time in 12 years, seeking to mend relations that had deteriorated severely.
""It could be an effort to foster a laid-back mood, through a casual dish that both Japanese and Koreans consider comfort food,"" he said. Rengatei's price for its omurice: 2,600 yen ($19.57).
Kawabata said the omurice in South Korea typically has a thinner and firmer layer of eggs, while the image of a perfectly crafted one in Japan has a fluffy, runny, almond-shaped covering of eggs that blanket the ketchup-fried rice.
""Yoon may have been impressed with the softness of Japanese-style omurice,"" Kawabata said.
Although Rengatei's original dish mixed the egg batter in with the rice, the omurice as Japanese people know it today was conceived for and popularised in the 1985 Juzo Itami film ""Tampopo"", a critically acclaimed meditation on food and one of Japan's best known movies.
Hiroshi Modegi, the third-generation owner chef of Taimeiken, which appears in the film, said he was disappointed that his restaurant was not the president's choice, but welcomed the renewed attention on omurice.
""I hope the world discovers that Japanese food culture also has a dish like this,"" he said.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,"Factbox: What Japan, South Korea leaders achieved at first working meeting in 12 years",Reuters,2023-03-16 11:13:00+00:00,,"TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met on Thursday in Tokyo, aiming to thaw years of diplomatic tension. It was the first visit by a South Korean leader to Japan for a bilateral working meeting in 12 years.
The following is what resulted:
Japan's trade ministry said it would lift export curbs to South Korea on some high-tech materials, namely fluorinated polyimides, resists and hydrogen fluoride.
It said the decision came after confirming the effectiveness of South Korea's export control regime at a three-day policy dialogue and South Korea's plan to withdraw its complaint filed at the World Trade Organization on Japan's export controls.
Tokyo imposed the curbs in 2019 as a dispute over the issue of how to compensate wartime forced labourers deepened. A Japanese trade ministry official said, however, that the lifting of the curbs was not related to the issue, a resolution of which was initiated by Yoon last week.

The two agreed to revive regular visits to each other's countries, or ""shuttle diplomacy"". Kishida said the visits would be frequent and informal, in hopes of building a personal relationship with Yoon.
The leaders agreed to restart a bilateral security dialogue, suspended since 2018, in view of what they called heightened threats to regional security with North Korea's frequent missile launches.
Yoon declared a ""complete normalisation"" of the intelligence-sharing GSOMIA (General Security of Military Information Agreement) pact, which Seoul threatened to pull out of in 2019.
Kishida said the two countries will set up a conference to discuss economic security matters.
Japan's biggest business lobby Keidanren and its South Korean counterpart, the Federation of Korean Industries, agreed to each set up a fund aimed at building ""future-oriented"" relations through joint projects in the areas of politics, economy and culture, and promote the exchange of younger people between the two nations.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,South Korea and Japan hail spring thaw amid missiles and weight of history,Sakura Murakami,2023-03-16 14:02:00+00:00,,"TOKYO/SEOUL, March 16 (Reuters) - The leaders of Japan and South Korea promised to turn the page on years of animosity at a meeting on Thursday, putting aside their difficult, shared history and pledging to work together to counter regional security challenges.
The summit between South Korea's Yoon Suk Yeol and Japan's Fumio Kishida in Tokyo - the first visit to Japan by a South Korean president in 12 years - highlights how the two U.S. allies have been brought closer by North Korea's frequent missile launches and growing concern over China's more muscular role on the international stage.
The urgency of the regional security situation - and the threat posed by North Korea - were underscored in the hours before Yoon's arrival, when the North fired a long-range ballistic missile that landed in the sea between the Korean peninsula and Japan.
The tension between the two has long undercut U.S.-led efforts to present a united front against China and North Korea.
""Up until now, the leaders of both countries weren't even able to meet for more than 10 years, despite being two neighbouring countries that are democracies, market economies and U.S. allies,"" said Hideki Okuzono, a professor of international relations at the University of Shizuoka.

""The fact that President Yoon visited Japan and the two countries held a bilateral meeting - rather than on the sidelines of an international forum - that alone should be commended as a possible turning point.""
The two countries agreed to drop an almost four-year trade dispute on some high-tech materials used for chips, an issue that has dogged their relationship even as the political importance of semiconductors, and securing their supply, has increased.
They also agreed to revive regular visits to each other's countries and agreed to restart a bilateral security dialogue that had been suspended since 2018. Yoon also declared a ""complete normalisation"" of an intelligence-sharing pact, known as GSOMIA, which Seoul threatened to pull out of in 2019.
The relationship has been strained by a dispute over wartime history, including over compensation of South Koreans forced to work under Japan's 1910-1945 occupation, as well as the issue of women and girls forced into Japanese military brothels.
""Today was a good day for shared interests, shared values and shared goals,"" U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said on Twitter.
Signs of a breakthrough came last week when Seoul announced a plan for its companies to compensate former forced labourers.
""This week Tokyo saw its cherry blossom trees blooming a little earlier than usual. I'm very happy to have this opportunity to start a new chapter of a forward-looking future of Japan and South Korea relations on this day when we can feel the arrival of spring,"" Kishida said as he faced Yoon across a table.

Yoon said North Korea's launch of a long-range ballistic missile that morning had shown the ""grave threat"" to international peace and stability.
""Today's meeting with Prime Minister Kishida has a special meaning of letting the people of our two countries know that South Korea-Japan relations, which have gone through difficult times due to various pending issues, are at a new starting point,"" Yoon said.
Japan will remove curbs on some exports to South Korea of critical materials for smartphone displays and chips while Seoul will drop a World Trade Organization (WTO) complaint against Tokyo, officials from both sides said.
Tokyo imposed the curbs in 2019 as tensions over a decades-old row with Seoul deepened.
The attempt for closer ties brought a rebuke from China, whose foreign ministry said it opposed the attempt by certain countries to form exclusive circles.
Still, Yoon faces scepticism at home. In a poll by Gallup Korea published Friday, 64% of respondents said there was no need to rush to improve ties with Japan if there was no change in its attitude, and 85% said they thought the current Japanese government was not apologetic about Japan's colonial history.
Nevertheless, economic ties are strong. The two were each other's fourth-largest export markets in 2021, according to the IMF. Japanese exports to South Korea totalled $52 billion, while South Korean exports totalled $30 billion, the data showed.
Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, said it and its South Korean counterpart, the Federation of Korean Industries, agreed to launch foundations aimed at ""future-oriented"" bilateral relations.
However, in a fresh reminder of the long-running tensions, two South Korean victims of wartime forced labour filed a lawsuit, seeking compensation from Japanese company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), their representatives said on Thursday.
Park Hong-keun, floor leader of South Korea's main opposition Democratic Party, said Yoon's visit should not stop at ""his trip down memory lane"" and asked Yoon to earn a true apology and resolution from Japan on forced labour issues during his trip.
Japan said the ""strategic challenge posed by China is the biggest it has ever faced"" in a defence strategy paper released in December. Tokyo worries that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has set a precedent that will encourage China to attack self-ruled Taiwan.
China's coast guard entered waters around disputed East China Sea islets on Wednesday to counter what it called the incursion of Japanese vessels into Chinese territorial waters.

China,/world/china/,China to create powerful financial watchdog run by Communist Party,Laurie Chen,2023-03-16 13:26:00+00:00,,"BEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - China will set up a financial watchdog run by the Communist Party, state media reported on Thursday, as part of a broad reorganisation of governing bodies set to give the ruling party direct control and supervision over financial affairs.
The creation of the Central Financial Commission will see the dissolution of the state-run Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC), a powerful body set up in 2017 and headed by former Vice Premier Liu He to curb risks in China's complex and often opaque financial system.
The new watchdog will be responsible for the top-level design, development and supervision of the financial sector, strengthening ""unified leadership on financial work"", according to a plan published by state media.
To strengthen the ideological and political role of the party in China's overall financial system, a separate Central Financial Work Commission will also be established.
The reorganisation of party and state-run financial bodies comes after Xi Jinping secured a precedent-breaking third term as party leader in October and also a new term as president earlier this month, making him China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

""The line between the party and the government has become decisively blurred, so there is no way that the new financial watchdogs will contradict with what the party wants,"" said Yan Wang, chief China strategist at Alpine Macro, a global investment firm based in Montreal.
Reuters previously reported that Beijing was planning to resurrect an elite party financial watchdog that operated between 1998 and 2003 to increase political control over the financial sector. It would be headed by a member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body helmed by Xi, sources previously said.
The revival of the high-level oversight body comes as Chinese leaders race to inject new momentum in the world's second-largest economy battered by three years of heavy COVID-19 curbs, a protracted property slump and weak external demand for the country's exports.
""From investors' point of view, the near-term impact of the regulatory overhaul is unlikely to be significant. Promoting growth is clearly Beijing's top priority, so it is unlikely to upset the market and hurt the economy with drastic policy changes,"" Wang said.
A detailed reform plan for state institutions was released during China's annual parliamentary meeting that concluded on Monday.
Under the State Council, helmed by the new Premier Li Qiang, China will establish the National Financial Regulatory Administration tasked with regulating the country's $57 trillion financial industry, excluding the securities sector.
The banking and insurance regulator will be abolished, and certain functions of the central bank and securities regulator will be transferred to the new financial administration.
Separately, China will establish a new Central Technology Commission to strengthen the party's centralised leadership over science and technology.
A Central Office for Hong Kong and Macau overseen by the party will be set up to supervise the implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" policy, and implement the governance of the central government in the two administrative regions.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council will be abolished.
China aims to complete the reorganisation of central government institutions by the end of 2023.
Carl Minzner, senior fellow at U.S. think tank the Council of Foreign Relations, said he expected an increasing trend towards the ""Party-ization"" of China's bureaucracy, with party organs steadily assuming roles once held by state bureaucracies, or even directly absorbing them.
""This both reflects Xi Jinping's drive to reassert the party's dominance over state and society alike, and represents a steady erasure of the limited boundaries between party and state that Chinese authorities themselves had attempted to draw during the post-1978 reform era.""

China,/world/china/,"Exclusive: China increasingly ambitious with 2023 growth target, may aim for up to 6%",Kevin Yao,2023-03-02 05:45:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SN6ILX4XAFNRHKXRVKOJKPM4CA.jpg,"BEIJING, March 2 (Reuters) - China is becoming increasingly ambitious with its 2023 growth target, aiming potentially as high as 6%, in a bid to boost investor and consumer confidence and build on a promising post-pandemic recovery, sources involved in policy discussions said.
Four of the sources said China was likely to aim for growth up to 6%, while three others said China was targeting 5%-5.5%. They all spoke on condition of anonymity as the discussions were held behind closed doors.
In all, those numbers point to rising optimism within Chinese policy circles compared with November, when government advisers recommended more modest targets ranging from 4.5% to 5.5%.
The previous recommendations were made weeks before China lifted the world's harshest COVID-19 curbs. Recent data showed the economy recovering from its pandemic shock at a better-than-expected pace.
The final growth target, which can be a range, will be announced on March 5, at the start of China's annual legislative meeting.
View 2 more stories 
""This year's growth target could be 5-6%,"" said one of the people involved in the discussions. ""We need to achieve an economic recovery, boost employment, and confidence, these are the key factors we need to consider.""
One of the three sources advocating for a more modest target warned ""the property sector is still falling and it's difficult to fill the gap while foreign trade is likely to drag on economic growth this year.""
None of the seven sources is involved in the final decision-making process.
The government is also set to unveil more stimulus during this month's National People's Congress, to mitigate the impact of property market weakness and waning global demand for its exports, four of the people said.
To spur growth, the government is expected to widen its annual budget deficit to around 3% of gross domestic product this year and issue about 4 trillion yuan in special bonds to support investment spending, they said.
The new economic leadership team, expected to be led by former Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang as China's new premier, are keen to show their ability to deliver better economic growth to create more jobs and ease funding strains on local governments, the four said.
China's economy grew 3% in 2022 from a year earlier, badly missing the official target of around 5.5%, as the COVID-19 pandemic, property market stress and slowing global demand took a heavy toll. Excluding 2020, when the pandemic started, it was the worst performance since 1976 - the final year of Mao Zedong's decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy.
It was also the biggest ever miss of a growth target. China previously only had narrow misses during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and during a currency crisis in 2014-15.
The last time China set a target range was in 2019 at 6-6.5%.
Some economists argue that ambitious annual growth targets in China are counterproductive, and policymakers should rather focus on structural reforms to improve the sustainability of any economic expansion.
Lofty goals have in the past pressured local governments to launch expensive infrastructure projects, which have contributed significantly to China's overall indebtedness of almost 300% of economic output.
Three of the sources also said China will stick to the long-standing inflation target of around 3%.
Consumption and services are leading China's recovery so far this year. Manufacturing activity also expanded at the fastest pace in more than a decade in February, an official survey showed on Wednesday, beating expectations.
Iris Pang, chief Greater China economist at ING, said in a note that this week's upbeat data gave the government strong reasons to set a high growth target of 5.5% to 6%.
On March 5, outgoing Premier Li Keqiang is due to deliver the 2023 government work report, which includes key economic goals and policy priorities.
Li was quoted by state media on Wednesday as saying that the government was still amending the work report.
""This year's growth will be higher than 6%, which is not high considering last year's low base,"" Yu Yongding, an influential government economist who previously advised the People's Bank of China, told Reuters.
Yu said a growth target of above 6% would help ""boost morale and stimulate China's economic growth potential.""

Europe,/world/europe/,"Dutch farmers' protest party scores big election win, shaking up Senate",Bart H. Meijer,2023-03-16 08:27:00+00:00,,"AMSTERDAM, March 15 (Reuters) - A farmers' protest party shook up the political landscape in the Netherlands on Wednesday, emerging as the big winner in provincial elections that determine the make-up of the Senate.
The BBB or BoerBurgerBeweging (Farmer-Citizen Movement) party rode a wave of protests against the government's environmental policies and looked set to have won more Senate seats than Prime Minister Mark Rutte's conservative VVD party.
A first exit poll projected BBB won 15 of a total of 75 seats in the Senate, which has the power to block legislation agreed in the Lower House of parliament, with the VVD dropping from 12 to 10 seats.
The meteoric rise of BBB is a major blow for Rutte's governing coalition, casting doubt over its aim to drastically cut nitrogen pollution on farms, the single issue upon which BBB was founded in 2019.
View 2 more stories 
""Nobody can ignore us any longer,"" BBB leader Caroline van der Plas told broadcaster Radio 1.
""Voters have spoken out very clearly against this government's policies.""
The government aims to cut nitrogen emissions in half by 2030, as relatively large numbers of livestock and heavy use of fertilizers have led to levels of nitrogen oxides in the soil and water that violate European Union regulations.
The nitrogen problem has crippled construction in the Netherlands as environmental groups have won a string of court cases ordering the government to limit the emissions and preserve nature, before new building permits can be granted.
The BBB says the problem has been exaggerated and that proposed solutions are unfairly balanced against farmers, leading to the closure of many farms and food production shortages.
Rutte's government has not had a Senate majority since the previous provincial elections in 2019 and must negotiate deals with mostly left-wing opponents.
The two most cooperative parties, Labour and GreenLeft, looked set to have held on to their seats, keeping their combined group at a par with BBB and possibly enough to maintain support for Rutte's policies.
BBB won a single Lower House seat in 2021, but its popularity has surged on the back of growing distrust of the government and anger over issues such as immigration.
Rutte's government, in its fourth consecutive term since 2010, has dropped to a 20% approval rating, its lowest in a decade.

Europe,/world/europe/,Analysis: German coalition bickering stalls policy at home and in Europe,Sarah Marsh,2023-03-16 07:05:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EURQR3ARSZJ5ZMFJOJSENIEFQY.jpg,"BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - Germany's first three-way coalition in decades was forged in crisis last year when unity was paramount. Now as it takes on major structural challenges, deep differences between the parties resurface, delaying critical decisions both at home and on the European stage.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the resulting energy crisis forced Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) to cross traditional red lines last year and agree hard compromises on nuclear energy, coal and defense.
Now though, as the urgency to act united subsides, they are locking horns over their signature policy issues in what they see as ""pay back time"" as one high-ranking government official put it.
The Greens in particular, but also the SPD, want to invest more in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The FDP on other hand, seeks a return to solid public finances after signing off on hundreds of billions of euros of exceptional expenditure during the pandemic and energy crisis.

Last week, those divisions prompted FDP leader and Finance Minister Christian Lindner, who has ruled out tax increases, to delay the presentation of the 2024 budget.
The risk, say analysts, including Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, is that such rifts could delay projects needed to modernize Europe's largest economy.
Around 30 government initiatives are now held up by the coalition itself, whether it is speeding up the construction of public infrastructure, limiting red tape on renewable energy projects or banning new oil and gas heaters.
Julia Reuschenbach, political scientist at Berlin's Free University, said the FDP in particular was acting as the ""inner opposition to its own government"", in its attempts to raise its profile after a string of bitter regional electoral defeats.
German coalition disputes are also spilling over into European Union policymaking, sparking irritation among partners.
The bloc had to delay a vote originally scheduled last week on a landmark law to end sales of new CO2-emitting cars in 2035 after last-minute objections by Transport Minister Volker Wissing of the FDP to what appeared to be a long-agreed move.
Over the past year, Germany's hesitations over sending heavy weapons to Ukraine have also aggravated European and NATO partners.
Brzeski said that while German governments had learned to cope with crisis, ""they do not have a good track record in dealing with structural transition - and this is what we are in now.""
Responding to such criticism, a government spokesperson said Berlin was already dealing with multiple challenges posed by the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.
""These are processes that take some time. But the government has already agreed many decisions in its first year-and-a-half to drive the transformation. And it will continue to do so.""
The German political system installed after the Nazi era ensures power is shared and restrained much more than in peers like Britain or France, said Philipp Koeker, political scientist at the University of Hanover.
Proportional representation, for example, means coalition governments are the norm, which can slow down decision-making.
But while some bickering between partners is hardly unusual, analysts and government insiders say lack of experience, electoral pressures and diversity of this coalition have contributed to the stalemate.
""Too many topics of dispute are simply being handed upwards,"" another senior government source said.
In an unusual exchange of letters last month, Lindner and Economy Minister Robert Habeck of the Greens had sparred over the budget plans, with the latter expressing concern there would be insufficient funds for environmental projects.
Unlike Habeck or Scholz, Lindner is also his party's leader, which puts him in a particularly tight spot as someone responsible for government policy but also expected to appeal to voters. That can require uneasy compromises especially given that FDP is now fighting for its life. It is polling at just 5%, around a half of what it won in the 2021 general election, and at the threshold of what is needed to enter parliament.
There are also divisions between the SPD and the Greens - the government decided recently for example to shelve plans for a national security council because the SPD-run chancellery and the Greens-run foreign ministry could not agree who should run it, according to the two government sources.
Scholz, who is often criticised for being overly cautious, theoretically can use his right to issue binding policy guidelines to tell ministers what to do, said University of Hanover's Koeker.
However singling out just one minister could could result in that minister's party exiting the coalition, he said.
Instead Scholz has chosen to downplay differences and seek to ensure each party feels well represented, said Gero Neugebauer, a political scientist at Berlin’s Free University.
""Above all he wants to keep the traffic light coalition together, even if it takes more time to reach decisions,"" he said, using the coalition's popular description based on party colours of red, green and yellow. ""That is the price.""

Europe,/world/europe/,"Poland breaks up Russian spy network, says minister",Reuters,2023-03-16 11:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7Y3AKJLR7ZLY3GCR67STJKSZQQ.jpg,"WARSAW, March 16 (Reuters) - Poland has broken up a Russian espionage network operating in the country and detained nine people it says were preparing acts of sabotage and monitoring rail routes to Ukraine, the interior minister said on Thursday.
An ally of Ukraine and hub for deliveries of weapons to Kyiv's armed forces, Poland says it has regularly found itself the target of Russian efforts to destabilise the country.
""In recent days, the Internal Security Agency has detained nine people suspected of collaborating with the Russian secret services,"" Mariusz Kaminski told a news conference.
The suspects were foreigners from countries to the east of Poland.
""The suspects conducted intelligence activities against Poland and prepared acts of sabotage at the request of Russian intelligence,"" he said.
Kaminski said six of the people detained had been charged with espionage for Russia and participation in an organised criminal group. Prosecution proceedings against three people detained on Wednesday were ongoing, he added.

""Internal Security Agency officers secured cameras, electronic equipment, as well as GPS transmitters that were to be mounted on transports with help for Ukraine,"" Kaminski said.
The group had also been ordered to carry out propaganda activities to destabilise relations between Poland and Ukraine, and they had been paid for their activities, he said.
Kaminski's statement came after private radio station RMF FM reported on Wednesday that Polish security services had detained six people suspected of spying for Russia. According to RMF, cameras were found close to the Jasionka airport near Rzeszow, which has become a transfer point for weapons and ammunition being delivered to Ukraine.
On Wednesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda met with CIA Director William Burns. The president's office said they discussed the security situation.
Several European countries have expelled Russian diplomats for alleged spying since the war in Ukraine dragged relations between Moscow and the European Union to historic lows.
In February, a Russian citizen who has been living and conducting business activities in Poland for many years has been charged with spying for Russia between 2015 and April 2022.

Europe,/world/europe/,Putin tells Russia's billionaires to put patriotism before profit,Reuters,2023-03-16 13:37:00+00:00,,"MOSCOW, March 16 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin urged Russia's billionaires on Thursday to put patriotism before profit, telling them to invest at home to shore up the economy in the face of Western sanctions.
Addressing Russia's business elite in person for the first time since the day he sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year, Putin told them their role was not just to make money but to support society.
""A responsible entrepreneur is a real citizen of Russia, of his country, a citizen who understands and acts in its interests,"" Putin said.
""He does not hide assets offshore, but registers companies here, in our country, and does not become dependent on foreign authorities.""
He hailed the ""high mission"" of entrepreneurs who looked after their workers and directed their talents not just towards extracting profit but also for the public good.
Billionaires Oleg Deripaska, Vladimir Potanin, Alexei Mordashov, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg, Viktor Rashnikov, Andrei Melnichenko and Dmitry Mazepin - whose interests range from metals and banking to fertilisers - were among those in attendance at the gathering.
View 2 more stories 
Putin said he wanted to hear their views on how to build a more dynamic economy that would lead to ""a noticeable improvement in the quality of life of people across the country"".
Though welcomed with a standing ovation, he was delivering a tough message to Russia's richest: that they need to think more about the needs of the country and less about their own bottom line.
When he met with them at the start of the war, Putin told them he had been left with no choice but to launch his ""special military operation"" - in effect forcing them into a public display of consent.
Many of the tycoons, known as oligarchs, were subsequently placed under sanctions by the West - something Putin has used as an argument that investing at home is safer. Last month he told business leaders that ordinary Russians had no sympathy for the confiscation of their yachts and palaces.
The president said on Thursday that what he called an attempt to destroy Russia's economy with sanctions had failed. But he also sounded a note of urgency, saying the country could not afford to sit back.
""I understand perfectly the threats that are taking place and what the ill-wishers are telling us, saying that Russia will have problems in the medium term. Yes, this is a threat we must keep in mind,"" he said.
""I urge you not to wait for these negative consequences of this medium term to come ... You need to act right now.""
In the clearest sign of rising demands on big business, the government - faced with a widening budget deficit - plans to raise around 300 billion roubles ($3.9 billion) in a windfall tax, though this will not affect oil, gas and coal firms.
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the tax would be set at around 5% of excess profits, TASS news agency reported. The levy will come into force legally from 2024, but the finance ministry expects companies to make payments this year as well, he said.
Russia is hoping to bring about economic growth this year, after a 2.1% slide in 2022. Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov told the congress that GDP and investment would grow this year, but stopped short of giving estimates.
The economy proved unexpectedly resilient in the face of sanctions last year, but a return to pre-conflict levels of prosperity may be far off as more government spending is directed towards the military.
Putin has effectively placed large parts of the economy on a war footing, with defence factories working round the clock to churn out weapons, ammunition and equipment.

Europe,/world/europe/,Ukraine says allies' concerns hamper talks on war compensation,Pavel Polityuk,2023-03-16 12:19:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7U7AZ7GRMJNMNEDY7XJ6WJ45LE.jpg,"KYIV, March 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's efforts to ensure it receives compensation from Russia for damage caused by its invasion are being hampered by allies' concerns about the legal precedents that might be set, a senior Ukrainian official said.
Kyiv is trying to secure an international agreement setting a legal basis for Russian assets frozen by other countries - notably billions of dollars in Russian central bank assets - to be transferred to Ukraine to help rebuild the country.
But, offering a rare insight into Kyiv's negotiations with its partners, deputy justice minister Iryna Mudra said some countries were worried about setting a precedent that would put their own assets at risk, by opening them to compensation demands over past conflicts in which they were involved.
Ukraine says receiving compensation from Russia is vital for its future. The government said at the start of this year that damage to the economy from Russia's invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, had passed $700 billion - money that it does not have.

""We have no option but to make Russia pay reparations. If it doesn't do it voluntarily, (let's) fill a (compensation) fund with Russian money, foreign exchange reserves, Russian assets,"" Mudra told Reuters in an interview this week.
""They (some countries) are afraid that a precedent could be set... that their foreign assets could be affected.""
She did not identify the countries that had expressed such concerns but said Ukraine was trying to allay their fears.
""This treaty will be exclusively for the situation of an egregious war of aggression"" in breach of the founding U.N. Charter and International Court of Justice rulings ""so that it cannot be used for other conflicts,"" she said.
Negotiations are being held following the U.N. General Assembly's adoption of a resolution in November calling for Russia to be held accountable for its invasion and recognising Russia is responsible for reparations in Ukraine.
It also recommended the creation by member states and Ukraine of a register to document information on damage, loss or injury caused by the invasion, which has killed thousands of civilians, uprooted millions and destroyed cities.
The West froze around half - or more than $300 billion - of Russia's international reserves after Moscow's invasion.
Moscow says it will do everything possible to stop the West ""plundering"" state assets to pay for reparations to Ukraine, and Russia's U.N. ambassador said the provisions of the U.N. resolution were ""legally null and void"".
Despite the obstacles ahead, Mudra said Ukraine hoped that an international mechanism for compensating Ukraine would be established within a year.
She also said she hoped an agreement on the creation of an international register of damage in Ukraine would be announced in May, and signed by foreign partners - including all the Group of Seven wealthy nations - by the start of June.
""This is the first - and an extremely important - step in the creation of this compensation mechanism,"" Mudra said.
""The process has started. It's inevitable, there's no way back.""

Europe,/world/europe/,'We live in hell': Volunteer bus evacuates wounded Ukrainian troops,Reuters,2023-03-16 10:35:00+00:00,,"March 16 (Reuters) - On a brightly painted bus that doubles as a high-tech medical evacuation unit in Ukraine, Stasik lies on one of six beds linked to blood pressure and heart monitors and intravenous drips for patients who need them.
The 45-year-old soldier, who gave only his first name, lost his right arm when a tank shell struck his position in fighting against Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.
The arm has been amputated and his condition is stable, and now he and nine other troops wounded in battle are on their way from a small hospital in a town that cannot be named for security reasons to a larger one in the central city of Dnipro.
There they will receive more advanced treatment and rehabilitation, but the journey would be perilous for some without a team of medics on hand to monitor their condition and administer painkillers and other drugs.
Six medics move up and down the narrow corridor between two rows of three beds that run the length of the bus, which is part of Ukraine's Hospitallers Medical Battalion that evacuates troops across Ukraine. Four more wounded sit at the back.

""This is really the start of something great,"" said Andrii Voloshin, 23, referring to the ""Avstriika Bus"" - named after the military call sign of an Austrian volunteer who worked on a similar coach before she was killed in a traffic accident.
That vehicle was badly damaged in the crash, so another has been built to replace it.
""We had no possibility before in Ukraine to deliver casualties in such numbers between hospitals,"" he told Reuters. ""It's important that we relieve hospitals near the front line so they are not overloaded.""
One side of the bus is covered with the giant painting of a woman's face surrounded by sunflowers, and on the other are written the words ""For Every Life"".
The initiative involves teams of volunteers rotating and spending several weeks on call, ready for when soldiers need moving further from the fighting.
It is a small part of a huge network of evacuation teams in Ukraine, linking soldiers in trenches to small teams in rear positions, then to field hospitals, small nearby facilities and eventually to large centres in serious enough cases.
Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed and wounded on both sides of the conflict since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine last February.
Stasik, who joked with a gold-toothed grin as the bus lurched over potholed roads, said his days in the military were over now he had lost an arm.
Asked whether he would miss his fellow soldiers as he attempts to return to civilian life, the former sawmill worker became more serious.
""On the front line you understand you can lose this person in a day or two and you try not to have this emotional attachment.
""To tell you the truth it makes no sense to miss the guys, because my comrades are dead. It's good that they are not in pain any more. You will die and you either go to paradise or to hell. But we live in hell here.""

Europe,/world/europe/,Scholz to seek reforms to boost EU competitiveness at Brussels summit,Reuters,2023-03-16 09:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2FT3BYVAPRNAHO6BATMGYHRBNE.jpg,"BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Thursday he will seek to boost European competitiveness through reforms at an EU summit in Brussels next week, including making state aid more flexible and completing capital markets and banking unions.
In a speech to the German Bundestag, Scholz urged the European Union to pull together to face a raft of challenges, including in response to a massive U.S. subsidy programme for clean technologies known as the Inflation Reduction Act.
European solidarity has repeatedly been tested in recent years as the bloc seeks to keep pace with the U.S. and China economically and support Ukraine to repel Russia's invasion.
As markets were roiled by wobbles at Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Scholz also urged the bloc to complete a unified banking market that aims to create a single system for regulating lenders and ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for rescuing banks.

""Our competitiveness is the prerequisite for economic success,"" Scholz said. ""And our competitiveness is the prerequisite for Europe's future as a geopolitical actor.""
As Scholz spoke, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) issued a statement warning that ""in the international race for raw materials and energy, Germany and Europe are increasingly left behind.""
The EU is unveiling a Critical Raw Materials Act aimed at keeping pace with the United States and China in access to raw materials. Scholz said raw material security will also top the agenda when he visits Japan for talks this week.
The Brussels summit will also discuss proposals to reform the EU's fiscal rules that were set up to limit government borrowing to safeguard the value of the euro. Such proposals have previously faced opposition from Berlin and Scholz called them a ""difficult topic"".
Turning to the war in Ukraine, Scholz said that EU member states will agree further measures to improve the continued supply of arms and ammunition to Kyiv, without going into specifics.
He said Germany was ready to open up its own military procurement projects to other EU countries in order to speed up the production of ammunition.

Europe,/world/europe/,EU climate diplomacy deal on hold as nuclear dispute deepens,Kate Abnett,2023-02-20 20:27:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PEOAFAGJMJKARHF5NWOGVNBHPI.jpg,"BRUSSELS, Feb 20 (Reuters) - European Union countries failed to adopt conclusions on climate diplomacy that had been planned for Monday, owing to a deepening spat over the role of nuclear energy in the green transition, EU officials said.
The upset is the latest development in a dispute between France and other countries who want more EU policies to promote nuclear energy's contribution to cutting CO2 emissions, and those like Germany and Spain who warn this risks distracting from efforts to massively expand renewable energy.
The debate - which focuses on hydrogen produced from nuclear or renewable energy - has already delayed negotiations on new EU renewable energy targets and threatened a multi-billion-euro hydrogen pipeline. Some EU officials fear it could spill into other green energy policies, potentially delaying laws needed to meet EU climate targets.
""There are outstanding obstacles, but they will be resolved,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said of the climate conclusions on Monday, without specifying what the obstacles were.
View 2 more stories 
The conclusions would set out the EU's diplomatic priorities ahead this year's U.N. climate summit. Speaking after a meeting of EU countries' foreign ministers, who had planned to approve the conclusions, Borrell said he expected countries to give written approval to a final text within days.
EU officials told Reuters the majority of the text had been approved - including plans for the EU to rally support for a global pledge to phase out fossil fuels ahead of the November U.N. climate summit.
But countries are struggling to agree on whether the text should explicitly promote low-carbon hydrogen - meaning hydrogen produced from nuclear electricity - or focus on hydrogen produced from renewable energy, they said.
""On the question of hydrogen ... there are different positions around the table,"" one diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity, who said officials were working to try to find a compromise quickly.
A draft of the conclusions, seen by Reuters, said: ""EU energy diplomacy will promote the increasing uptake and system integration of renewable energy, hydrogen and its derivatives.""
The draft added that EU diplomacy would also promote ""safe and sustainable low-carbon technologies"".
Scaling up use, domestic production and imports of emissions-free hydrogen fuel is central to Europe's plans to decarbonise industries such as fertiliser and steelmaking.
France, which has historically derived 70% of its power from nuclear reactors, and countries including Hungary and the Czech Republic, want more EU recognition of nuclear energy, and are for example pushing for nuclear-based hydrogen to count towards EU renewable energy targets.
On the other side are countries such as Germany, which is phasing out its reactors, and Spain. They says they acknowledge nuclear's low-carbon contribution, but that it should not be put on a level footing with renewable energy sources like wind and solar.

Europe,/world/europe/,French pension reform heads for final parliamentary votes on Thursday,Elizabeth Pineau,2023-03-15 22:04:00+00:00,,"PARIS, March 15 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's much-disputed plan to raise the retirement age by two years to 64 moved forward on Wednesday as a select group of lawmakers from both houses of parliament agreed a compromise text, despite nationwide protests.
But approval of the deeply unpopular bill - which has faced huge street protests and repeated job walkouts - by the lower house of parliament on Thursday is far from a done deal.
Ruling party officials have acknowledged the numbers there were tight and lawmakers from the conservative Les Republicains (LR) and centrist groups said they were being courted by ministers hoping to convince them to vote the changes through.
It should not be too hard to get the Senate's approval, as it is dominated by LR.
If too tight for comfort in the lower house, the government may resort to a procedure known as ""49:3"", which would allow it to push the text through without a vote. That would ensure the text was adopted but would risk anger on the streets.

Opinion polls show a vast majority of voters oppose the changes, and unions, and protesters, have warned they will continue their mobilisation even if the bill is voted through on Thursday.
""We will continue the fight no matter what,"" said Philippe Martinez, the head of the hardline CGT union.
""If they vote for this reform, I don't think things will go down well, because we see that blue-collar workers, communities of workers have gone against this reform. People have had enough,"" Yvonnick Dauve, a welder and unionist in Ancenis-Saint-Gereon, said at a march in western France.
Disruptions to train services and air traffic will continue on Thursday, as will a garbage collectors' strike that has seen more than 6,000 tonnes of rubbish pile up in Paris. France's energy sector has also been hit hard.
Macron and his government say the changes to the pension system, one of the most generous among industrialised nations, are necessary to keep the pension budget in the black. At stake for the president are not just financial gains, however, but also his reformist credentials.
One key question will be the cost of the measures agreed by Macron's camp to get LR's support, including a softener for those who started to work early, and a top-up for working mothers.
The government had initially said that pushing back the retirement age by two years and extending the pay-in period would yield an additional 17.7 billion euros in annual pension contributions, allowing the system to break even by 2027.
There was no official estimate on Wednesday of the impact of the compromise deal.
But Philippe Vigier, a centrist lawmaker who was part of the select group that negotiated the deal, told reporters that tweaks to the initial draft bill cost billions, and accounts would now be balanced in 2030.

DLF said on Thursday it has sold out its luxury residential project in Gurugram near New Delhi in 72 hours, generating more than 80 billion rupees ($967 million) in sales, confirming a Reuters story from earlier this month.
Luxury housing is booming in India. A record 65,700 luxury housing units were sold in 2022, thanks to rising disposable incomes and a surge in demand after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially, developers say, for spacious apartments with conveniences like concierge services and spas.
This growing demand from consumers wanting to upgrade their homes and splurge more is a key reason why DLF will continue to focus on the luxury housing space, Chief Executive Officer Ashok Kumar Tyagi told Reuters in an interview.

""We've been strong in this premium luxury, super luxury segment,"" he said.
""We've sort of made it very transparently clear that we are not into the truly affordable (segment) ... I think it's a great segment. But it's just that we don't find adequate ways of making it profitable for us.""
Luxury condominiums, defined as those selling above 15 million rupees ($183,000), accounted for 17% of all launches in 2022, an at least five-year high, data from Anarock Property Consultants data shows.
On the other hand, launches of once-popular affordable homes — those priced below 4 million rupees — halved to 20% of the total in the period.
DLF's Arbour project in Gurugram attracted more than 3,000 applications for 1,137 apartments priced at $869,000 each. Rival Godrej Properties (GODR.NS) is offering $3 million apartments to clients selected by invitation, Reuters has reported.
Tyagi added DLF would look at more luxury housing projects in big cities like New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, but declined to share further details on future plans.

India,/world/india/,"World should move on from Ukraine war, focus on poverty - India's G20 negotiator",Reuters,2023-03-15 12:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SQLLZRNTZ5JDPIY7IY4VU37KTI.jpg,"NEW DELHI, March 15 (Reuters) - Russia's war in Ukraine has brought the world to a standstill when urgent action is needed to address growing global poverty, India's G20 summit negotiator Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday.
Kant's comments follow two back-to-back G20 ministerial meetings in India in the last three weeks overshadowed by the war, which entered its second year last month.
India, which holds the bloc's presidency this year, has sought to highlight the economic impact of the conflict as well as issues such as climate change and poorer countries' debt.
""Europe cannot bring growth, poverty, global debt, all developmental issues to a standstill across the world,"" Kant told reporters.
""Especially when the south is suffering, especially when 75 countries are suffering from global debt, especially when one-third of the world is in recession, especially when 200 million people have gone below poverty line. Can that one war bring the entire world to a standstill?""

""Nutrition has been impacted, health outcomes have been impacted, learning outcomes have been impacted, people have become stunted and wasted and we are just concerned with one Russia and Ukraine war,"" Kant said. ""The world needs to move on and Europe needs to find a solution to its challenges.""
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.
India has declined to blame Russia for the war and has sought a diplomatic solution while boosting its purchases of Russian oil.
Kant said it is ""premature"" to even talk about whether U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would attend a summit of leaders of the bloc in New Delhi on Sept. 9-10.
The Kremlin said on Monday that it was not ruling out Putin attending the summit.
Putin has not travelled beyond the former Soviet Union since sending his armed forces into Ukraine in February last year, and missed November's G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.
The G20 includes the rich G7 nations as well as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, among other countries.

India,/world/india/,India's Patanjali Foods falls after stock exchanges freeze promoters' shares,Reuters,2023-03-16 05:49:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/I6Z3XQYASRPJZMOPOFDUEDTDHU.jpg,"BENGALURU, March 16 (Reuters) - Shares of India's Patanjali Foods Ltd (PAFO.NS) fell as much as 5% on Thursday, a day after the edible oil maker said the country's stock exchanges froze promoters' shares as they still held a stake of around 80% in the company.
India's markets regulator, the India's Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), mandates the minimum public shareholding in listed companies at 25%.
The stock is down 22.4% year to date.
Patanjali, in an exchange filing on Wednesday, said it received a notification from both the BSE, formerly known as the Bombay Stock Exchange, and the National Stock Exchange, informing it about the share freeze.
As per the notification, about 292.6 million shares would be affected, the company said.
The deadline for minimum public float norms passed towards the end of January 2023, as the three-year period after company's relisting ended.

However, the company on Wednesday said the action by stock exchanges would not have any impact on its financial position.
The promoters are confident of achieving minimum public shareholding within next few months, it said, adding that the promoters' equity shares were already locked in till April 2023 as per SEBI norms, and none of the shares were pledged.
Patanjali Ayurved, the company's parent firm, acquired Ruchi Soya Industries in 2019 and renamed it Patanjali Foods in 2022.
This is not the first time that Patanjali Foods has stepped into regulatory crosshairs.
In September 2021, SEBI issued a warning to the company after its co-founder, well-known yoga guru Baba Ramdev, attempted via a viral sermon to get his followers to invest in Ruchi Soya's share sale during its January 2020 relisting.
In March 2022, SEBI had asked Patanjali to allow retail investors to withdraw their bids from the 43 billion rupee ($519.84 million) share sale.
The regulator’s move followed instances of unsolicited messages being sent to Patanjali Ayurved’s users to invest in Ruchi Soya's share sale.

India,/world/india/,India using SWIFT global payment system to settle Russia dollar trade - source,Shivangi Acharya,2023-03-15 12:27:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YED3IQXXHJICRGPF7DVGADOYSE.jpg,"NEW DELHI, March 15 (Reuters) - Indian companies are using the SWIFT global payment system to settle dollar payments with Russia, a top trade official said on Wednesday, even though many Russian banks are blocked from the network due to Western sanctions.
The West blocked access to SWIFT for several Russian banks, including Sberbank and VTB, soon after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February last year to target Russian trade, making it harder for Russian companies to do business. SWIFT underpins financial transactions globally.
“We are using SWIFT for dollar payments,"" the official, who did not want to be named, said, when asked about the payment gateway being used for Russian payments.
The official did not give more details about the banks that Indian traders were using to make the dollar payments.
India's trade and finance ministry did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
India's imports from Russia have increased nearly five times in the April 2022 to February 2023 period to $41.56 billion from $8.54 billion, compared with the same period the prior year, according to data released by the government on Wednesday.

Last month, Reuters reported India's Russian oil imports climbed to a record 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, up 9.2% from December, with Moscow still the top monthly oil seller to New Delhi, followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
India has been using varied currencies to settle trade with Russia since the war in February last year.
""Payments happen in different currencies, including dollar, euros, dirham,"" the country's Directorate General of Foreign Trade Santosh Kumar Sarangi told reporters.
Indian refiners payed for most of their Russian oil purchased via Dubai-based traders in United Arab Emirates dirhams instead of U.S. dollars, Reuters has reported.

India,/world/india/,India govt unlikely to roll back tax plan on high-value life insurance-sources,Nikunj Ohri,2023-03-15 05:21:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/H6PN425UMFOX7I2Q42DAXPX7U4.jpg,"NEW DELHI, March 15 (Reuters) - The Indian government is unlikely to make changes to its budget proposal of taxing the total returns on high-value life insurance policies, two government officials said on Wednesday, amid demands by insurance companies to reconsider the move.
The government, presenting the 2023/24 budget on Feb. 1, said it would scrap the tax exemption on the total returns upon maturity of life insurance policies if their aggregate premium exceeded 500,000 rupees ($6,103).
The move, which will come into effect for policies issued from April 1, has rattled insurers, with top company executives meeting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and finance ministry officials to petition them to reconsider the proposal.
""The government is not keen to revise the 500,000 rupees threshold limit as it impacts only high net-worth individuals, and not the common man,"" said one of the officials, who did not want to be named.

The government will, however, consider allowing these investments to be adjusted for inflation, also known as 'indexation', the official added.
The Department of Financial Services has suggested that the Prime Minister's Office allow these indexation benefits, said another government official, adding the PMO will make the final decision.
India's finance ministry did not reply to Reuters' emails and messages seeking comment. All three government officials declined to be named as the parliament is yet to pass the budget.
Indexation means adjusting purchasing price to the rate of cost inflation index (CII) that is published periodically by the income tax department.
If allowed, indexation will lower the policyholder's tax liability, said Kuldip Kumar, an independent tax consultant.
This benefit will mean insurance proceeds will be taxable as capital gains rather than ""income from other sources"", as proposed in the budget, which will reduce the tax rate to 20% from 30%, Kumar said.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Analysis: Egypt asset sales face obstacles as state maintains grip,Patrick Werr,2023-03-16 12:43:00+00:00,,"CAIRO, March 16 (Reuters) - Egypt has promised the International Monetary Fund it will roll back the state's involvement in the economy and allow private companies a much greater role, yet several recent moves show it continuing to expand its holdings and tighten its control.
As part of a $3 billion, 46-month financial support package announced with the IMF in October, Egypt pledged to level the playing field between the public and private sectors, strengthen the business climate and reduce the role of the state and military in non-strategic areas.
Egypt desperately needs the proceeds from privatisation after a series of economic shocks. Its progress on economic reform could determine whether it can ride out the financial crisis exposed by the war in Ukraine and lay the ground for sustainable growth.
But previous reform promises and privatisation plans have often failed to materialise, and analysts say a state ownership policy that is meant to signal where the state will step back and is viewed as a key commitment by the IMF, leaves the government plenty of room for manoeuvre.

""A lot of it is actually a justification for a massive state intervention in sectors that are supposedly strategic,"" said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut.
On Dec. 7, six weeks after the IMF deal was announced, a regulation was published in the official gazette stating that people seeking to set up any of 83 economic activities would need written permission from security directorates.
The activities included operating grocery stores, kiosks, wedding decor services, hair salons and shoe shine stands. The number was reduced to 35, according to the government-owned Ahram Gate website, following criticism on social media.
Licence applications under the measure could take up to three months and would impose new fees on applicants.
In a January decree, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi allocated the military 2km of land on either side of nearly 3,700 km (2,299 miles) of planned highways, much of it with high development potential.
Egyptian authorities did not respond to a request for comment.
Egypt set a target in 2022 of raising $10 billion annually over four years through private investment in state assets. Last month, it said its would sell stakes in 32 companies over the coming year.
On Sunday, the government said it would begin procedures this week to list two army-owned companies - petrol stations operator Wataniya and bottled water firm Safi - on the stock exchange.
But many of the firms named by the government had already been earmarked for years. Sales of stakes in almost all of the 23 companies slated for privatisation in 2018 were put off, with officials blaming market turbulence for the delays.
Though sovereign funds in hydrocarbon-rich Gulf states bought some assets as they came to Egypt's help last year, momentum has stalled.
Egypt has established its own sovereign fund to bring in private investors to develop state assets, but the move appears designed to attract capital without relinquishing control, said Sayigh.
""They want others to help the state with its financial burden, but it's still the state that determines priorities and investments,"" he said.
Future asset sales will be complicated by an expansion under Sisi of the military's often opaque economic role, analysts say.
The military, as well as other security institutions, are exempt from value-added taxes for goods and services needed for armament, defence and national security under a 2016 law, from real estate taxes under a 2015 decree, from income taxes under a 2005 law and from import tariffs under a 1986 law. The Ministry of Defence can decide which goods and services qualify.
Businessmen have long complained privately of other disadvantages, including in dealing with an oppressive bureaucracy.
Military generals are frequently present at meetings where economic policy is discussed, according to statements from the presidency.
In return for new finance, Gulf states have been attaching more conditions than in the past, including a demand for economic reforms in line with IMF recommendations.
But even if it materialises, investment from such political allies may not galvanise the private sector, in the absence of clear signs the state is withdrawing, analysts say.
So far, the government has leaned towards selling minority stakes and keeping control in its own hands, making them less attractive to prospective buyers.
In parliament, nationalist deputies have railed against a fund designed to leverage Suez Canal assets and against the prospect of an indebted state selling discounted resources to Gulf investors.
Rather than rolling back its holdings, the military-owned Tolip chain of nearly two dozen hotels last month bought a luxury hotel in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh from the publicly traded Remco Tourism Villages Construction Co. (RTVC.CA) for 700 million Egyptian pounds ($22.7 million), according to a stock exchange disclosure.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Analysis: Frustrated Khamenei pushed for Saudi-Iran deal clinched in China,Parisa Hafezi,2023-03-16 13:03:00+00:00,,"DUBAI, March 16 (Reuters) - Eager to end its political and economic isolation, Iran had been trying for two years to restore ties with its long-time rival Saudi Arabia, an Arab heavyweight and oil powerhouse.
Last September, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei lost patience with the slow pace of bilateral talks and summoned his team to discuss ways to accelerate the process, which led to China's involvement, two Iranian officials told Reuters.
Beijing's secret role in the breakthrough announced last week shook up dynamics in the Middle East, where the U.S. was for decades the main mediator, flexing its security and diplomatic muscles.
""The Chinese showed willingness to help both Tehran and Riyadh to narrow the gaps and overcome unresolved issues during the talks in Oman and Iraq,"" said an Iranian diplomat involved in the talks.
The deal was struck after a seven-year diplomatic rupture. For Saudi Arabia, a deal could mean improved security. In 2019, the kingdom blamed Iran for attacks on its oil installations that knocked out half of the its supply.
View 2 more stories 
Iran denied involvement. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan has said that Saudi investments into Iran could now happen quickly.
Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in 2016 after its embassy in Tehran was stormed during a dispute between the two countries over Riyadh's execution of a prominent Shi'ite Muslim cleric.
Hostility between the two powers had endangered stability in the Middle East and fuelled regional conflicts including in Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.
Asked whether the Saudi-Iran deal might fray, Wang Di, a senior Chinese diplomat involved in the talks in Beijing, told reporters the rapprochement was a process without expectations that all issues would be solved overnight.
""The important thing is for both sides to have the sincerity to improve ties,"" he said, according to state Xinhua news agency reporter Yang Liu on Twitter.
Saudi Arabia, Washington's most important Arab ally, began exploring ways to open a dialogue with the Islamic Republic two years ago in Iraq and Oman, said a Saudi official.
This lead to a critical moment in December, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Riyadh. In a bilateral meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the president expressed his desire to broker dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
""The crown prince welcomed this and promised to send, for us to send to the Chinese side, a summary of the previous rounds of dialogue, a plan on what we think on how we can resume these talks,"" said the Saudi official.
In February, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi visited Beijing and the Chinese forwarded Riyadh's proposals that were accepted by the Iranian side, the official added.
An Iranian official said the deal covered a range of issues, from security concerns to economic and political issues.
""I will not go into details but we have agreed that neither country will be a source of instability for the other one. Iran will use its influence in the region, particularly in Yemen, to help Riyadh's security,"" the official said.
""Both sides will do their best to preserve security in the Persian Gulf, guarantee the oil flow, work together to resolve regional issues, while Tehran and Riyadh will not get involved in military aggression against each other.""
A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthi movement in Yemen for years.
Exactly how much support Iran has given the Houthis, who share a Shi’ite ideology, has never been clear. Sunni countries in the Gulf accuse Iran of interference via Shi’ite proxies in the region, something Tehran denies.
""Iran is the main supplier of weapons, training, ideological programs, propaganda and expertise to the Houthis and we are the main victim. Iran can do a lot and it should do a lot,"" said the Saudi official.
Iran chose its senior national security official Ali Shamkhani to lead the negotiations because he is an ethnic Arab, said a regional source who belongs to Khamenei's inner circle.
""The Chinese showed willingness to help both Tehran and Riyadh to narrow the gaps and overcome unresolved issues during the talks in Oman and Iraq,"" said the Iranian diplomat involved in the talks.
""China was the best option considering Iran's lack of trust towards Washington and Beijing's friendly ties with Saudi Arabia and Iran. China also will benefit from a calm Middle East considering its energy needs,"" said an Iranian official, briefed about the meetings.
After decades of mistrust, ongoing frictions should not come as a surprise. ""This agreement does not mean that there will be no issues or conflicts between Tehran and Riyadh. It means that whatever happens in the future it will be in a 'controlled' way,"" said an Iranian insider, close to Iran's decision-making elite.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Factbox: Who has run Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion?,Reuters,2023-03-16 06:10:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NE5GJAB57NJ57LPXJU2BHOGOO4.jpg,"BAGHDAD, March 16 (Reuters) - The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was designed to pave the way for a thriving democracy but the mostly ineffective governments elected since 2003 have left many Iraqis disappointed.
Iraqis say their leaders have yet to deliver on promises to reform the economy, fight corruption, improve worsening public services and combat poverty and unemployment.
Under a governing system in place since the post-Saddam Hussein constitution was adopted in 2005, the prime minister is a member of the Shi’ite Muslim majority, the speaker is a Sunni and the largely ceremonial role of president is held by a Kurd.
But that formula often comes under heavy strain as a result of sectarian agendas and fails to prevent bloodshed.
Here are the main current political figures.
The Shi'ites are led by mercurial cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on one side and by a collection of mostly Iran-aligned groups known as the Coordination Framework on the other.
Populist Sadr, once an outlaw wanted dead or alive during the U.S. occupation, rose to become a political kingmaker and Iraq’s most powerful figure.
View 2 more stories 
Sadr led an armed insurgency against the U.S. occupation of Iraq after American and international troops toppled Saddam.
He inherited a mass following of mostly impoverished Shi’ites from his father, Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, assassinated in 1999 after openly criticising Saddam.
When Saddam was executed in 2006, witnesses taunted him by chanting Moqtada’s name as he was led to the gallows, leaked footage showed.
In Iraq’s 2006-2008 civil war, Sadr's Mehdi Army was accused of forming death squads that kidnapped and killed Sunni Muslims. Sadr has disavowed violence against fellow Iraqis.
Sadr opposes all foreign interference, especially from Iran. He has a thousands-strong militia and wields wide power using loyalists working for the Iraqi state.
THE COORDINATION FRAMEWORK:
Maliki is a former prime minister and leader of the Dawa party which dominated successive Iraqi governments after 2003. He has close ties with Iran, which supported Dawa’s opposition to Saddam during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war.
He has links with armed militias and state security, leads a powerful parliamentary bloc, and is Sadr’s fiercest opponent.
Maliki was pressured to leave office by both the United States and Iran for failing to stop Islamic State's seizure of a third of the country in 2014. He has denied allegations that his sectarian policies pushed Sunnis into the arms of Islamic State.
Hadi al-Amiri, once a dissident fighting Saddam from exile in Iran, is one of Iraq's most powerful politicians.
He leads the Badr Organisation, which started as a Shi’ite armed group supported by Iran in the 1980s. Badr makes up a big part of the Popular Mobilisation Forces, a state paramilitary organization that contains dozens of Iran-backed factions.
Opponents have accused him of running sectarian death squads following the U.S. invasion, an accusation he denies.
Portraits of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei are a fixture in Badr offices. ""Khamenei...is the leader not only for Iranians but the Islamic nation. I believe so and I take pride in it,"" Amiri once said.
Khazali is a former insurgent who fought as part of Sadr’s Mehdi Army against U.S. troops before splitting off to form his own militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, which became a military-political group and holds a number of seats in parliament. The United States has designated his organisation a terrorist group.
Iraq's parliament elected veteran Kurdish politician Abdul Latif Rashid as president in 2022. Iraq's minister of water resources from 2003-2010, Rashid is the uncle of Bafel Talabani, president of one of the main Kurdish political parties.
Kurdish parties have carved out a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq since 2003 but the dominant Barzani and Talabani clans have long been at loggerheads over power and resources in a region rich in oil and gas.
Power-sharing governments in Iraqi Kurdistan have largely kept a lid on mistrust since the two sides fought a civil war in the 1990s. But Kurdish leaders' internal divisions have weakened much of their formerly moderating influence on Iraqi politics.
Iraq’s Sunnis dominated the country under Saddam, himself a Sunni. But the tables turned in 2003 with the U.S.-led invasion that ushered in Shi’ite dominance leaving Sunnis, vulnerable.
Sunnis have been divided by clan and ideological rivalries since 2003, which Sunni voters complain makes them weak against Shi'ite rivals.
Two major Sunni parties have emerged as winners in the last election -- Taqaddum, led by speaker of parliament Mohammed al-Halbousi and the Azm alliance of Khamis al-Khanjar.
Halbousi, an engineer from western Iraq, has formed good relations with Shi'ites and Kurds who helped him become speaker.
Khanjar is a millionaire businessman who bankrolled Sunni politicians and fighters who sought to create autonomous region for the minority sect, a move criticised by Shi'ites as an invitation to tear Iraq apart.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Israeli protesters paint 'red line' leading to Supreme Court after Netanyahu spurns compromise,Maayan Lubell,2023-03-16 13:22:00+00:00,,"JERUSALEM, March 16 (Reuters) - Jerusalem woke on Thursday to the sight of a long red line painted by protesters along roads leading to Israel's Supreme Court, hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a compromise deal for his government's planned judicial overhaul.
Police said they had arrested five people who had disguised themselves as workers to carry out the protest action overnight.
Drone footage showed a small group of people in protective suits spraying a wide red stripe along mostly deserted roads leading from a police and magistrate's compound up to the Supreme Court in central Jerusalem.

The hard-right government's drive to limit Supreme Court powers while increasing its own power in selecting judges has caused alarm in Israel and abroad about the country's democratic checks and balances as protests have swelled for weeks.

In what they dubbed ""a day of resistance,"" demonstrators blocked roads around commercial hub Tel Aviv and in other cities. At the Haifa port a few flag-toting protesters on boats, including former navy men, tried to block docking lanes.

""We are here to protest our democracy, our country, because we feel that our country is under brutal attack of the government, the Israeli government,"" said choreographer Renana Raz in Tel Aviv.
Netanyahu, upon departing late on Wednesday for a state visit to Germany which has voiced concern over the judicial plan, said a proposed compromise outlined by President Isaac Herzog would not restore balance to the branches of government.
His nationalist-religious coalition says the Supreme Court too often overreaches and intervenes in political matters it has no mandate to rule on. Defenders of the court say it is a bastion of democracy, protecting rights and liberties.
Economists, legal experts and former security chiefs have warned that the judicial plan, which has yet to be written into law, will wreak havoc on the country's economy and isolate Israel internationally.
Netanyahu, who is on trail for corruption charges he denies, says it will strengthen democracy and boost business. Members of his coalition driving the changes hope to win parliament's final approval of them by April 2.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Iran's top security official in UAE to seek stronger ties,Reuters,2023-03-16 12:27:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HVNRVW3ORBN67ELMLHIIJG2EUQ.jpg,"DUBAI, March 16 (Reuters) - Iran's top security official held high-level talks in the United Arab Emirates on Thursday as Tehran seeks greater outreach to Gulf states amid mounting tensions with the West over the country's nuclear work and its drone sales to Russia.
The visit by Iran's Supreme National Security Council secretary Ali Shamkhani comes days after Tehran and Riyadh reached a China-facilitated deal to re-establish relations and re-open embassies within two months after years of hostility.
""Considering the suitable platforms that have been created since a year ago for the development of relations between Iran and the UAE, I see this trip as a new stage for political, economic and security relations,"" said Shamkhani in Abu Dhabi, Iranian state media reported.
The UAE downgraded its diplomatic ties with Iran after Riyadh severed its ties with Tehran in 2016 following the storming of the Saudi embassy in the Islamic Republic by hardline protesters over Riyadh's execution of a prominent Shi'ite cleric.

After years of animosity on different sides of geo-political rivalries, the UAE started re-engaging with Tehran in 2019.
It resulted in upgraded diplomatic ties last year between Iran and the UAE, which has business and trade ties with Tehran stretching back more than a century, with Dubai emirate long being one of Iran's main links to the outside world.
Growing worries about warming relations between Israel and its former Arab foes, including normalisation agreements between Israel and some Arab nations known as the Abraham Accords, have pushed Tehran's clerical rulers to pursue regional detente.
Tension between Iran and the West have mounted over Tehran's nuclear activity and its supply of drones for Russia's war in Ukraine, as well as the Islamic Republic's clampdown on months of anti-government-protests. Tehran denies selling drones to Moscow for use in the Ukraine war.
The Islamic Republic's arch-foe, Israel has threatened to carry out military attacks if world powers fail to salvage Iran's 2015 nuclear pact. Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington have stalled since September.
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump reneged on the accord in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions. In response, Tehran breached the deal in several ways, including by rebuilding stocks of enriched uranium.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Iraqi ambush of Americans made a mockery of 'Mission Accomplished',Michael Georgy,2023-03-16 08:52:00+00:00,,"DUBAI, March 16 (Reuters) - A year after President George W. Bush launched the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, four U.S. civilian security contractors in SUVs took an ill-fated turn into the Iraqi city of Falluja.
Their assignment was to protect a convoy of catering trucks. It would be their last, and what happened to them would prove a defining moment in a conflict that -- far from being ""Mission Accomplished"" as Bush had declared less than a year earlier -- had only just begun.
Masked insurgents ambushed the contractors using rocket-propelled-grenades and AK-47 rifles on a main street in Falluja, part of the Sunni Triangle, a central region of mainly Sunni Muslims that had been the powerbase of Saddam Hussein who had been toppled by the invasion launched on March 20, 2003.
Arriving in the city an hour or so after the ambush on March 31, 2004, I was confronted by a crowd kicking the head of an incinerated body. Others dragged a charred corpse by its feet.
View 2 more stories 
I was taking notes, trying to make sense of the furore, when a boy, who was probably aged about nine, approached. Standing over two blackened bodies, he offered to help me out.
""We hung the others from a bridge. Would you like to see them? I can take you there,"" he said.
The attack in Falluja, 32 miles (50 km) west of Baghdad, and those violent scenes heralded not just more attacks on U.S. troops but a broad insurgency that swelled the ranks first of Al Qaeda and then Islamic State, miring Iraq in conflict and chaos from which it has yet to fully emerge two decades later.
Falluja still bears the scars of battles that have raged through its streets. Beyond the smart main road entering the city, walls bear the pockmarks of bullets and some buildings that were pounded into the ground in military operations still lie in ruins. The city is chronically short of funds to rebuild war damaged infrastructure which would cost more than $2 billion, Talib al-Hasnawi, Falluja town council chief, told Reuters.
""It’s true that the rebuilding process is below our expectations due to the limited resources and budget, but we are not stopping rebuilding what wars have damaged,"" he said.
Still, security in the city today is much improved. Families travel from Baghdad just to have dinner at Falluja Badiya, a famous kabab restaurant. Trade, agriculture and fish farming are on the increase, al-Hasnawi said.
Twenty years ago, violence across Iraq was stoked further by sectarian tensions, pitting minority Sunnis, who had enjoyed a privileged status under Saddam Hussein, a Sunni himself, against Shi'ites, the majority who had been oppressed under his rule.
Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and insurgents were killed in the years that followed the U.S. invasion, launched on the basis of a U.S. charge that Iraq had stockpiled weapons of mass destruction, a claim that proved a chimera.
When U.S. combat troops pulled out of Iraq in 2011, 4,418 U.S. soldiers had died, alongside hundreds of foreign troops, contractors and civilians.
In the two decades of turmoil since the invasion, Falluja repeatedly emerged as a hotspot.
""Falluja is the cemetery of Americans,"" the crowd had chanted on that day in 2004 when gunmen killed the four contractors who worked for the Blackwater USA security firm: Jerry Zovko, Wesley Batalona, Michael Teague and Scott Helvenston.
I saw an Iraqi douse one of the corpses with petrol, sending flames soaring into the air. Witnesses said at least two bodies were tied to cars and dragged through the streets. Later in the day, I saw body parts hung from a telephone line.
Iraqi frustration at what they saw as the mismanagement of the U.S. administration had been quick to emerge after the U.S. and coalition forces swept into Baghdad and across Iraq.
Paul Bremer, who governed Iraq's Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) for 13 months after Saddam Hussein was toppled, said the Falluja attack was ""certainly a horrendous act"" but he told Reuters in a March 14 interview that U.S. forces were not deployed in sufficient number in Iraq to prevent the worsening of security.

""We never had enough people on the ground in Iraq,"" he said.
Ultimately Bremer disbanded Iraq's army, leaving 400,000 soldiers without jobs, which Western and Iraqi critics of the U.S. action said provided a ready pool of recruits for Islamist groups and other insurgents that emerged.
In the interview with Reuters, Bremer defended his decision, saying the army, which consisted of Saddam's soldiers, had attacked the Kurds and the Shi'ites, and so preserving the force would have risked a civil war.
As violence spiralled, Al Qaeda militants seized control of Falluja, prompting two U.S. offensives. After U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq, Islamic State seized control of the city in 2014, leading to a seige by Iraq's army and Shi'ite militias.
In 2004, I followed the boy who had offered me help through Falluja, a city of low rise middle class homes owned by families who had struggled under years of international sanctions ever since Saddam Hussein's 1990-1991 invasion of Kuwait that was ended by another U.S.-led coalition.
We reached the bridge from which two of the contractor's corpses were dangling. Below them were families, some with young children, honking car horns or clapping in celebration.
""I am happy to see this,"" said one 12-year-old onlooker, a boy called Mohammad. ""The Americans are occupying us so this is what will happen.""
U.S. officials at the time blamed the killings on supporters of Saddam Hussein, saying they wanted to restore the old order, but said the United States would not be diverted from building democracy.
""We will be back in Falluja. It will be at the time and place of our choosing. We will hunt down the criminals,"" Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt said in response to the killings.
Days later, the U.S. military launched an offensive saying it aimed to ""pacify"" the city, rid it of insurgents and find those responsible for the March 31 ambush.
Under Saddam Hussein's repressive rule, Sunnis in Falluja and across Iraq had been the main beneficiaries of official patronage in business, government posts and the army, while Shi'ites were sidelined. That changed after the U.S. invasion.
As power shifted to the majority Shi'ite community, a Sunni insurgency gathered pace. A host of militias, backed by predominantly Shi'ite Iran, also emerged.
Iraq's death toll mounted, amid car and truck bombs, improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers, beheadings, sectarian death squads and torture chambers.
Salman al-Fallahi, a tribal sheikh from Falluja, looks back today on the violence that has scarred a generation of Falluja youths psychologically and which he thinks could have been averted.
""I believe if we were to go back in time, the Americans would not have done what they did and we would not have responded with such severity,"" he told Reuters. ""We would have avoided many things.""
Al-Hasnawi, Falluja's town council chief, said the killing of the contractors was against Islam and later ""Falluja and all its people lived in hell because of this incident"".
But he stressed that people today are ready to move on from what he called ""the dark days"".
""Now almost everyone in Falluja understands the consequences of such reckless actions ... all the following destruction and death in Falluja was a result of killing the four Americans and mutilating their bodies,"" he said. ""Enough is enough.""

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,"Meeting of Turkey, Syria, Iran, Russia, officials postponed -Turkish source",Reuters,2023-03-16 09:05:00+00:00,,"ANKARA, March 16 (Reuters) - A meeting of the deputy foreign ministers of Russia, Turkey, Iran and Syria, scheduled for this week, has been postponed to an unspecified date, a source from the Turkish foreign ministry said on Thursday.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week that the deputy foreign ministers of the four countries would meet this week in Moscow, ahead of planned talks between foreign ministers at a later date, aimed at resolving the crisis in Syria.
The deputy foreign ministers' meeting had been scheduled for March 15-16, state-run Anadolu Agency reported on Monday.
But the meeting was postponed for ""technical reasons"", a Turkish foreign ministry source said, without elaborating.
In a sign of potential rapprochement between Ankara and Damascus, Syrian and Turkish defence ministers held landmark talks in Moscow in December, alongside their Russian counterpart, marking the highest-level encounter since the start of the Syrian war more than a decade ago.
View 2 more stories 
In January, Cavusoglu said he could meet his Syrian counterpart in February to discuss normalisation between the two neighbours.
NATO member Turkey has been a major backer of the political and armed opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during the 12-year conflict in Syria, and has sent its own troops into swathes of the country's north.
Moscow is Assad's main ally and Russia encouraged a reconciliation with Ankara.
After meeting his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian last week, Cavusoglu said Iran wanted to join the talks between Turkey, Syria and Russia, and Turkey agreed.
In a rare visit abroad, Assad met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Wednesday.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Syria's Assad would like more Russian bases and troops,Guy Faulconbridge,2023-03-16 08:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/UEPFU4PF4NPZZAPSHJYK3G53PU.jpg,"MOSCOW, March 16 (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad said on Thursday that he would welcome any Russian proposals to set up new military bases and boost troop numbers in the Middle Eastern country, suggesting Russia's military presence there should become permanent.
When Russia intervened in the Syrian Civil War in 2015, it helped tip the balance in Assad's favour, ensuring the Syrian leader's survival despite Western demands that he be toppled.
Assad, who met President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin on Wednesday, has supported Russia's war in Ukraine and told Russia's state news agency RIA that Damascus recognises the territories claimed by Russia in Ukraine.
Syria, Assad said, would welcome any Russian proposals to set up new military bases and boost Russian troop numbers - and said they need not be temporary.
""We think that expanding the Russian presence in Syria is a good thing,"" Assad told RIA in an interview. ""Russia's military presence in any country should not be based on anything temporary.""
View 2 more stories 
""We believe that if Russia has the desire to expand bases or increase their number, it is a technical or logistical issue.""
Assad's years as president have been defined by the conflict that began in 2011 with peaceful protests before spiralling into a multi-sided conflict that has fractured the Middle Eastern country and drawn in foreign friends and enemies.
He has stitched much of his state back together with the help of Russia and Iran, aided by the fact that his allies were always more committed to his survival than his enemies were to his defeat.
Alongside the Hmeimim air base, from which Russia launches air strikes in support of Assad, Moscow also controls the Tartus naval facility in Syria, its only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, in use since the days of the Soviet Union.
Russia's defence ministry said in January that Russia and Syria had restored the al-Jarrah military air base in Syria's north to be jointly used. The small base east of Aleppo was recaptured from Islamic State fighters in 2017.
In Moscow, Assad thanked Putin for the help Russia had given to Syria after a devastating earthquake and praised the Kremlin chief for his support of Syrian unity.
Syria stood beside Russia on the issue of Ukraine, Assad said.
""Because this is my first visit since the start of the special military operation in Ukraine, I would like to repeat the Syrian position in support of this special operation,"" Assad told Putin, according to a Kremlin transcript.
Syria recognises the territories of Ukraine which Russia has seized as Russian, Assad said.
""I say that these are Russian territories, and even if the war had not happened, these are historically Russian territories,"" Assad told RIA.
Russia has claimed around a fifth of Ukraine and says the lands are now part of Russia. Ukraine says it will fight until every last Russian soldier is ejected from Ukraine. The West says the annexation of Ukrainian territory is illegal.
Assad said Russia and Syria planned to sign an agreement on economic cooperation in the coming weeks.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Syria's Assad says he won't meet Erdogan until Turkey ends its 'occupation',Suleiman Al-Khalidi,2023-03-16 13:24:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2IWHYNN25ZNORKLE7BLCGX56IQ.jpg,"AMMAN, March 16 (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al Assad said on Thursday he would only meet Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan when Turkey was ready to completely withdraw its military from northern Syria and restore the situation that existed before the Syrian war.
Turkey has been the biggest military and political ally of the Syrian opposition, which controls the last rebel bastion in northwest Syria. Ankara has set up dozens of bases and deployed thousands of troops in northern Syria, preventing the Russian backed Syrian army from re-taking the region.
Visiting Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad told Russian TV station Sputnik that there was no point in a meeting with Erdogan until Turkey's ""illegal occupation"" ended.
""This is linked to arriving at a stage Turkey would clearly be ready and without any ambiguity to exit completely from Syrian territory and end its support of terrorism and restore the situation that prevailed before the start of the war on Syria,"" Assad told Sputnik in an interview relayed by Lebanon's pro-Iran Hezbollah's group's al Manar TV station.

""This is the only situation when it would then be possible to have a meeting between me and Erdogan. Aside from that what's the value of such a meeting and why would we do it if it would not achieve final results for the war in Syria,"" he added in the clearest remarks on the recent rapprochement.
The defence ministers of the two countries met late last year for the highest-level talks between the two neighbours, whose governments have been at odds since 2011, when the Arab Spring uprisings reached Syria and plunged the country into war.
Hundreds of thousands of people have died in the conflict, which drew in numerous foreign powers, and splintered the country.
During low points in relations between Ankara and Damascus, Erdogan called Assad a terrorist and said there could be no peace in Syria with him in office, while Assad called Erdogan a thief for ""stealing"" Syrian land.
Turkish and Russian officials say preparations are being made for a meeting between deputy foreign ministers of Turkey, Syria and Iran ahead of planned talks between foreign ministers.
Assad acknowledged the role played by Russia in encouraging a rapprochement between Erdogan and himself.
""We trust the Russian side who has played a mediator role to facilitate the communications, but within the basis of Russian policy of respecting sovereignty of states.. and the exit of illegal foreign forces from Syrian territory,"" Assad said.
Assad has said the presence of Russian troops in Syria was legitimate as his government has requested Moscow's support.

The company, whose roughly $16 billion in assets include an indoor ski resort and the Mall of the Emirates, said in an emailed response to questions that the cuts were made this week as part of an ""ongoing review"".
Three sources familiar with the move said it was part of a restructuring following the abrupt removal of former chief executive Alain Bejjani in January.
""We continually assess our operations and adapt to accommodate evolving market conditions, streamline our activities and drive efficiencies,"" said MAF, which also holds the Middle East franchise rights of French retailer Carrefour.
""These measured actions and continuous business-as-usual reviews enable Majid Al Futtaim to deliver competitive returns to our shareholders while maximising opportunities for value accretive, profitable and sustainable growth,"" it added.

MAF appointed long-time insider Ahmed Galal Ismail as chief executive in January, replacing Bejjani after eight years in the role, in a shake up more than a year after the company's founder died. MAF gave no reason for the leadership change at the time.
The cuts were made at the holding level of the company, in addition to divisions such as its leisure and entertainment operations, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
MAF was founded by Emirati businessman Majid Al Futtaim, whose death at the end of 2021 was announced by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who paid tribute to him as one of the emirate's pioneers.
The privately held company on March 6 reported a 12% increase in 2022 revenue to 36.3 billion dirhams ($9.89 billion), and a 2% decline in net profit to 2.4 billion dirhams.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Lebanon central bank head attends corruption hearing - sources,Laila Bassam,2023-03-16 13:37:00+00:00,,"BEIRUT, March 16 (Reuters) - Lebanon's central bank governor Riad Salameh attended a court hearing in Beirut on Thursday with visiting European investigators probing whether he embezzled vast sums of public funds, three people familiar with the matter said.
The 72-year-old governor, whose 30-year tenure at the bank is to end this summer, had missed a session on Wednesday after his lawyer objected to the French and German officials' presence.
But the presiding judge dismissed that motion and ordered a new session on Thursday.
Salameh is being investigated alongside his brother in Lebanon and in at least five European countries over accusations of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade and laundering some of the proceeds abroad.
He denies wrongdoing and says the accusations are part of an attempt to scapegoat him for Lebanon's financial meltdown.

His brother Raja, who also denies wrongdoing, is meant to appear in front of a Lebanese judge on Friday, also with European investigators present.
Lebanon has taken steps to freeze the pair's assets.
Last year, prosecutors in Germany said Salameh was a suspect in a case that led to the freezing of some 120 million euros($132 million) of Lebanese assets abroad.
Salameh for decades enjoyed strong backing from Lebanese political and financial elites as he financed a state rife with corruption and enforced policies that earned commercial banks massive profits.
But he has faced increased scrutiny since a 2019 financial crisis resulting from decades of profligate spending, corruption and unsustainable policies by Lebanon's leaders.
As probes have converged, some of his long-time allies have viewed him as a burden and have moved to distance themselves from him, according to political sources who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the subject.
Salameh's has said he would leave the bank at the end of his sixth term in July - a move that would mark a milestone in the crisis. A successor has so far not emerged.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Analysis: Hasty rebuild could leave Turkey at risk of another quake disaster,Ceyda Caglayan,2023-02-20 13:50:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2GHGV6OAQNJPVKTFXQTFUK2OAA.jpg,"ISTANBUL, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's plan to rebuild quickly after devastating earthquakes rocked the country risks courting another disaster unless urban planning and building safety are carefully re-considered, architects and engineers say.
Days after Turkey's worst earthquake in modern history, Erdogan vowed to rebuild the southern disaster zone within a year, an undertaking conservative estimates put at $25 billion and others expect to be far higher.
Authorities say more than 380,000 units in 105,794 buildings are in urgent need of demolition or have collapsed, out of 2.5 million structures across the region.
A building boom has defined Erdogan's two-decade rule, during which his government has collected some $38 billion in quake-linked taxes, according to Reuters calculations. The tax, still in place, could provide quick financing to start rebuilding efforts.
View 2 more stories 
Facing elections by June, Erdogan's government has endured a wave of criticism over both its response to the devastation and what many Turks say were years of policies that led to tens of thousands of buildings being so easily destroyed.
Erdogan had said the government would cover rents of those who leave quake-hit cities. ""We will rebuild these buildings within one year and hand them back to citizens,"" he said.
But experts believe he needs to carefully enforce seismic-safety standards and build safer structures in the area, which straddles one of three faultlines criss-crossing Turkey.
""It is not only necessary to replace the demolished buildings, but also to re-plan the cities based on scientific data such as not to build on faultlines and to learn lessons from past mistakes,"" said Esin Koymen, former head of Istanbul Chamber of Architects.
""The first priority is new planning, not new building.""
The quakes on Feb. 6, which also hit neighbouring Syria, left more than a million homeless and killed far more than the latest official tally of 46,000 people in both countries.
They devastated southern Turkey in the dead of winter, with overnight temperatures near freezing, leaving many emergency tents inadequate for the homeless. More than 2 million others have evacuated the region that was home to more than 13 million.
The earthquakes revealed the fragility of Turkey's infrastructure, experts said, given they ravaged both modern and ancient buildings including hospitals, mosques, churches and schools.
Some now worry the government's ambitious timeframe leaves little time to fix past mistakes.
""When they say 'we start the construction in a month, we finish it in a year', without the city planning work, frankly, this means that the disaster we are experiencing has not been noticed,"" said Nusret Suna, deputy head of the Chamber of Civil Engineers.
""It takes months to make city plans ... it is very wrong to ignore those plans.""
Urbanisation Minister Murat Kurum said last week the government would consider detailed geological surveys in its city reconstruction plans, and that tenders would be held.
The bill to rebuild houses, transmission lines and infrastructure is around $25 billion, or 2.5% of GDP, U.S. bank JPMorgan said in a report. Another report from business association Turkonfed estimated damages to housing at $70.8 billion.
And analysts say costs could overshoot initial estimates.
Over 20 years in power, Erdogan used major real estate projects to showcase Turkey's rising prosperity. Public and private builds have boosted jobs and new housing stock, and helped his opinion poll ratings.
The looming presidential and parliamentary elections, which could be delayed due to the quake, pose Erdogan's biggest political challenge to date given a cost-of-living crisis weighed heavily on Turks well before the disaster struck.
Some critics have said the state exacerbated the crisis by awarding ""friendly"" companies lucrative construction contracts over the years in return for political and financial support.
Pinar Giritlioglu, the Istanbul head of the Chamber of City Planners, said: ""Unfortunately, the rentier system instead of science continues to rule everything.""
The government has vowed to investigate anyone suspected of responsibility for the collapse of buildings, and has arrested dozens of people so far.
Though there is no definite data on the more than 20 million buildings in the country, former Urbanisation Minister Mehmet Ozhaseki said when in office in mid-2018 that ""probably more than 50% of all buildings"" contravened housing regulations. The Urbanisation Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about current figures.
Opposition politicians accuse Erdogan's government of failing to enforce building regulations, and of mis-spending special taxes levied after the last major earthquake in 1999 in order to make buildings more resistant to quakes.
Erdogan has repeatedly dismissed what he calls opposition lies meant to obstruct investment.
In 2018, the government issued an amnesty for existing buildings that had broken the construction rules - for a fee, a practice also carried out under previous governments before 1999.
While state housing agency TOKI built just 1 million quake-resilient houses over past two decades, about 5% of buildings in Turkey, the private sector built slightly more than 2 million sturdy homes during the same period, according to Urbanisation Minister Kurum.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK bans TikTok on government phones over security concerns,Muvija M,2023-03-16 13:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/B7JXDT7DJFIHZML6UQ6JQJGJ6A.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday it would ban TikTok on government phones with immediate effect, a move that follows other Western countries who have barred the Chinese-owned video app over security concerns.
""The security of sensitive government information must come first, so today we are banning this app on government devices. The use of other data-extracting apps will be kept under review,"" Cabinet Office minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement.
TikTok has come under increasing scrutiny due to fears that user data from the app owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, undermining Western security interests.
The British government had asked the National Cyber Security Centre to look at the potential vulnerability of government data from social media apps and risks around how sensitive information could be accessed and used.

The United States, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission have already banned the app from official devices.
""Restricting the use of TikTok on government devices is a prudent and proportionate step following advice from our cyber security experts,"" Dowden said.
TikTok said it was disappointed with the decision and had already begun taking steps to further protect European user data.
""We believe these bans have been based on fundamental misconceptions and driven by wider geopolitics, in which TikTok, and our millions of users in the UK, play no part,"" a TikTok spokesperson said.
""We remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns but should be judged on facts and treated equally to our competitors.""
Dowden told parliament government devices would now only be able to access third party apps from a pre-approved list.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK's Labour attacks planned pension changes as giveaway to the rich,Kate Holton,2023-03-16 10:43:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party vowed on Thursday to reverse the government's planned pension changes, saying they were a giveaway to the top 1% of pension savers at a time when many households are being hit by tax increases and high inflation.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt surprised his Conservative Party by announcing in a budget statement on Wednesday that he would no longer impose tax penalties on lifetime pension savings which exceed 1 million pounds ($1.2 million).
Hunt said the reform was part of his bid to keep more older people in work and address a shortage of workers in Britain.
The Labour Party, which is well ahead of the Conservatives in opinion polls before an election that is expected in 2024, said the move was the ""the wrong priority, at the wrong time, for the wrong people"".
Labour said the policy would mean that people with more than 1.4 million pounds in their pension pot would pay a total of around 150,000 pounds less in tax, at a time when basic rate taxpayers are facing higher tax bills.

""The budget was a chance for the government to unlock Britain's promise and potential,"" Rachel Reeves, Labour's would-be finance minister, said. ""But the only surprise was a 1 billion-pound pensions bung for the 1%, a move that will widen the cost-of-living chasm.""
Hunt defended the changes, saying their cost was dwarfed by 94 billion pounds worth of government support for households to soften the surge in the cost of living.
He added that the pensions changes were urgently needed to address a shortage of doctors. Some long-serving senior doctors have cut back their hours or retired early as they near the lifetime pension limit, adding to strains in the National Health Service (NHS).
""I don't think it is the wrong values to support our NHS,"" Hunt told BBC radio when asked about criticisms that the government was helping higher earners.
""If you're asking what will have an impact on ordinary families up and down the country, it is getting their NHS operation done more quickly. And this is the simplest and quickest way to resolve that issue.""
Labour said it would provide a more targeted scheme for doctors.
The Resolution Foundation, a think-tank which focuses on issues facing low- and middle-income households, described the tax change to discourage early retirement as hugely regressive and wasteful.
It said raising the annual tax-free pension contribution allowance to 60,000 pounds from 40,000 pounds, combined with the scrapping of the lifetime allowance, would cost the government 1.2 billion pounds.
The Resolution Foundation also said it could lead to an increase in employment of 15,000 – but at a cost of around 80,000 pounds per extra worker.
Even that employment gain could be overstated as the support could ""actually encourage some people to retire earlier than they otherwise would have done"", the think tank said.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), another think tank, said it viewed official forecasts of the employment gain from the measure as optimistic, and said the government should have tightened rules which allow pension savings to be passed on to heirs free of inheritance tax.
""The lack of any coherent strategy here remains deeply disappointing,"" IFS director Paul Johnson said.
Plans to expand state-funded childcare to families with children under the age of three were also not certain to give a big boost to the number of workers and would mostly benefit parents who were already in work, the IFS said.
But they would lead to the government paying for over 80% of formal childcare for pre-school children in England, up from close to zero in 2000, the think tank added.
""This is a major expansion of the welfare state,"" Johnson said.
The focus on tax support for the wealthiest had echoes of the criticism that met the ""mini-budget"" of former Prime Minister Liz Truss and her finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng in September. They were later forced to reverse their plan to scrap the top rate of income tax for Britain's highest earners.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK PM Sunak's new Brexit deal faces parliamentary test next week,Andrew Macaskill,2023-03-16 13:52:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/P3YR3OVOJZJ35FGCW3RJAY6HUM.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - British lawmakers will vote next week on whether to back the central element of the government's recent deal with the European Union to reform post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland in the first parliamentary test for the agreement.
The House of Commons leader Penny Mordaunt said on Thursday that there would be a debate on March 22 on a motion to approve the measures needed to implement the so-called ""Stormont brake"".
The brake enables Britain to stop new EU laws from applying to goods in Northern Ireland if so requested by a third of lawmakers in the province's devolved legislature.
The deal, announced last month, seeks to resolve tensions caused by the Northern Ireland protocol - a complex agreement that set the trading rules for the British-ruled region that London agreed before it left the EU but now says are unworkable.
View 2 more stories 
Like the protocol, the new deal aims to avoid the need for customs checks at the border with EU member Ireland.
A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Thursday there would be no overall vote on the new deal. He said while there could be other votes on parts of the deal, next week's would be the main one because the government considered it to be the ""most significant"" part of the agreement.
""We said parliament would have its say on the framework,"" the spokesman said. ""This vote honours the prime minister's commitment to provide MPs with the opportunity to vote on the new arrangements.""
The wording of what members of parliament will vote for next week will be published on Monday.
The head of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) this week voiced his strongest concerns to date over the UK-EU deal, saying his party was seeking changes from the British government.
A key test of the deal is its ability to convince the DUP to end a year-long boycott of Northern Ireland's power-sharing government over the original post-Brexit trade rules.
The debate next week is expected to be followed by a vote on measures to implement the brake. The opposition Labour Party has said it supports the deal overall, so those measures are likely to pass comfortably.
However, the debate will provide the first tangible test of sentiment among the DUP and also within Sunak's own Conservative Party, some of whom have expressed scepticism and are yet to say whether they would back it.
Conservative lawmakers who are part of the pro-Brexit European Research Group have asked for an analysis of the agreement by a so-called ""star chamber"" of legal experts.
The head of the European Research Group, Mark Francois, said on Thursday that the analysis will be completed before the vote.
""Members of the group will no doubt pay close attention to the star chamber's conclusions, prior to any vote,"" he said.
Former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who negotiated the protocol, said earlier this month that he would struggle to vote for the new deal, insisting it still allows the EU too much influence in the United Kingdom.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK government agrees pay deal with healthcare unions - report,Muvija M,2023-03-16 13:15:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XARZF3OO6FMPFBLFHC6BD2VGN4.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Healthcare workers in England and the British government have reached an agreement on pay, the i newspaper reported on Thursday, in what would be a breakthrough following months of strikes in the state-run National Health Service.
The government, led by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, is under growing pressure to quell the worst run of worker unrest in the country since the 1980s, with strikes affecting almost every aspect of a normal life from healthcare and transport to schools and border checks.
The newspaper report said the proposed deal would resolve a dispute among nurses and ambulance workers, with a tentative agreement expected to be announced later on Thursday.
The BBC reported that a one-off payment ""well above £1,000"" was being offered for 2022-23 along with a pay rise closer to 5% for 2023-24.
The government's health department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for a comment on the reported agreement, while trade unions representing different NHS workers also did not confirm a deal.

Earlier, finance minister Jeremy Hunt made optimistic comments about an imminent resolution with NHS staff earlier in the day.
""I hope so ... We have engaged very productively with the NHS unions and so I'm keeping my fingers crossed,"" he told the BBC.
Any offer would still be put to a vote among union members working for the health service, which has been under strain from walkouts by nurses, doctors and ambulance workers for higher wages to cope with surging inflation.
The potential breakthrough comes just a day after half a million Britons went on strikes to coincide with his presentation of the government's budget, some parts of which opposition Labour Party has accused as being ""the wrong priority, at the wrong time, for the wrong people"".
The NHS, which has been free at the point of use since 1948 and a source of pride for many Britons, has been particularly impacted as it was already grappling with a staffing crunch and just coming off the pandemic-induced strain on its capacity.
A resolution would be a huge relief, not just for the government and staff but also patients as a record 7.2 million Britons are on waiting lists for treatment.
A union representing junior doctors, 50,000 of whom are currently on strike, told Reuters that their dispute would not be covered in the deal.
In February, nurses in England paused strike action to enter intensive talks with the government, while unions representing ambulance workers also called off planned strikes after agreeing a fresh round of talks.
Before reports of a deal Unite said it expected significant movement today. It did not offer further comment after the report. Asked about the i report, Unison said talks were ongoing.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,"UK's Hunt risks busting his budget rule, head of fiscal watchdog says",William Schomberg,2023-03-16 11:58:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PZN6WBCTEFLJZAS6N4USJVSCIM.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - British finance minister Jeremy Hunt risks smashing one of his budget rules because he is already running close to its limit and there will be many spending and tax pressures ahead, the head of Britain's budget watchdog said on Thursday.
The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that Hunt's new tax and spending plans, announced on Wednesday leave him with a buffer of only 6.5 billion pounds ($7.85 billion) for hitting his target of getting debt as a share of economic output falling in five years' time.
OBR Chair Richard Hughes said Hunt had given himself more leeway last November when he extended the target horizon by two more years.
""So even with two years of extra time, and a somewhat brighter economic outlook, and a bit more potential output in the long run from higher employment, he is still struggling to meet that fiscal rule,"" Hughes said at a panel discussion about the budget organised by the Resolution Foundation think-tank.
View 2 more stories 
Hunt used his budget on Wednesday to announce extra spending on childcare, tax rule changes and other incentives to get more people into work, alongside incentives for business investment, in a bid to speed up Britain's slow pace of economic growth.
Hunt was likely to face calls for further freezes of fuel duty - a regular feature of budgets over the past decade - and he has suggested he also wants higher spending on defence and future reductions in taxes for businesses, Hughes said.
""When you combine those things, that busts the rules by a country mile,"" he said.
Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak committed to the latest version of Britain's fiscal rules in November after the chaos in bond markets triggered by former Prime Minister Liz Truss's big, unfunded tax cut plans.
Speaking at a separate event, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, Paul Johnson, said the budget rules also appeared to lie behind the government's decision to put a three-year limit on a new tax incentive for business investment.
Making the incentive last longer would have pushed up debt levels in the crucial fifth year of the government's target.
""This really is the tail of a badly designed fiscal rule wagging the dog of fiscal policy. Government needs to learn that stability and consistent long-term strategy are vital for companies looking to invest,"" Johnson said.

Under the penalty the company will pay 2,111,798 pounds to Ofgem's voluntary redress fund, with the company also issued with a nominal fine of 1 pound.
“In addition to this overcharging, it is concerning that UGP failed to return credit owing to former customers and retained such large sums in their own account; only refunding customers following Ofgem's intervention,"" Ofgem said in a statement.
Ofgem said the average customer was overcharged by 2,000 pounds with one customer overcharged more than 22,000 pounds.
The company, which provides energy to non-domestic customers, lists businesses such as a brewery in Yorkshire and charity Age Concern as previous customers on its website.
Money from the redress fund will be distributed to appropriate organisations for the benefit of energy consumers, Ofgem said.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,"New tax credit scheme a lifeline for British biotech, say execs",Natalie Grover,2023-03-15 20:27:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PZN6WBCTEFLJZAS6N4USJVSCIM.jpg,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Britain's budget has offered a shot in the arm to research-intensive biotech and life-sciences sector, company executives said on Wednesday, as the government seeks to put the industry in the global vanguard.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt said if 40% or more of expenditure of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) was on research and development (R&D) and they were not yet profitable, they could claim credit of 27 pounds ($33 ) per 100.
The announcement was met with considerable relief by small drug developers who can take years, typically spending millions, before ever seeing a medicine hit the market.
The new credit scheme goes a long way to quell the concern around lowering of some R&D tax relief for SMEs announced last October, said Kevin Pojasek, CEO of Oxford-based Enara Bio.
It should also encourage investors who will see more value for their money.

""The government were basically saying 'we care about life sciences' but pulling away one of the greatest levers that we had to attract investment,"" said Iain McGill, CEO of London-based Quell Therapeutics, referring to last year's changes.
""So this coming back ... is a real lifeline.""
There are about 6,548 businesses in the UK life sciences industry, of which 70%-80% are SMEs, government figures show.
The devil will be in the details, such as whether the scheme requires SMEs to have not made a profit for a year or for longer, warned Hugo Fry, CEO of London-based RQ Biotechnology.
But it appears to be as good a system, if not better, than what was in place before, he said.
It would allow his company to buy more equipment, employ a couple of extra scientists, and pay for up to an additional five months of research, he added.
The UK life sciences sector has been under pressure.
It was heavily exposed to the now collapsed Silicon Valley Bank, but crisis for the industry was narrowly avoided thanks to HSBC (HSBA.L)'s buyout of the bank's troubled UK arm on Monday.
And although the UK has renowned scientific research centres, it has long struggled to attract the level of funding U.S. biotech hubs in Boston and San Francisco have.
""Have we reached the heights of Massachusetts? No, we haven't. But this (budget) is going to help,"" said RQ Bio's Fry.
Another bright spot in the budget was 10 million pounds in extra funding for the UK drugs regulator, the MHRA, over the next two years to hasten the approval process.
However, whether drugs are deployed in the country depends on the watchdog NICE which determines whether the benefit of the medicines is worth their cost, executives highlighted.
A key worry has also been the sharp rise in a so-called ""clawback tax"" on branded drugs.
The tax, designed to make branded drugs more affordable, caps annual increases in National Health Service (NHS) drug spending, but if that limit is exceeded the government recoups the excess from suppliers.
The payback rate jumped from 5% in 2019 to 26.5% this year. That problem still needs resolving, executives said.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,Analysis: UK voters unlikely to share Hunt's budget optimism,William Schomberg,2023-03-16 01:28:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Finance minister Jeremy Hunt tried to show that Britain's economy was turning a corner in his budget statement on Wednesday, but his chances of bolstering his Conservative Party's fortunes before the next election look limited.
Britain will now skirt a recession, official forecasters said, allowing Hunt to spend 20 billion pounds ($24.1 billion) on measures including further energy subsidies to help households, childcare to get more people working, and investment incentives for business.
But the big picture for the world's sixth-biggest economy remains one of weak growth and high debt, offering little room for fiscal manoeuvre to a government fighting to turn around its weak standing in opinion polls before an expected 2024 election.
The immediate outlook is less sombre: The economy is due to shrink by 0.2% in 2023, not 1.4% as previously thought. But government forecasters still expect living standards to fall more over the two years to March 2024 than at any point since records began in the 1950s.
View 2 more stories 
The Office for Budget Responsibility also said fundamental weaknesses weighing on the economy were still being exacerbated by Brexit which has hit business investment since the 2016 referendum, and by the pandemic which caused half a million people to leave the jobs market, hobbling many firms.
""It all adds up to a situation in which Jeremy Hunt today has to work a lot harder than his predecessors just to keep debt from rising in normal times,"" OBR Chair Richard Hughes said. ""And normal times have been hard to come by in recent years.""
The OBR said there were big questions about just how many people would return to the labour market under the childcare, pension and welfare reforms that represented the key plank of the government's pro-growth budget plan.
It also said Hunt's three-year business investment incentives would bring investment forward at a cost to later years. The opposition Labour Party has promised ""certainty, consistency and incentives for investment.""
A snap opinion poll suggested voters were sceptical about the Conservatives' latest plan - among 3,100 people surveyed immediately after the budget by YouGov, only three in 10 thought it would be good for the economy.
Hunt sought to take a more upbeat approach in his speech to parliament.
He said the economy under his watch was ""proving the doubters wrong"" thanks in part to the emergency measures he took late last year when he was drafted into the Treasury to fix the ""mini-budget"" chaos of former Prime Minister Liz Truss.
But the fiscal rules that he and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak adopted to calm the bond market are likely to leave them with very little space for a pre-election reversal of a tax burden that is heading for a 70-year high.
The OBR said no finance minister since George Osborne created the fiscal watchdog in 2010 had faced a tighter margin for meeting a key fiscal target than Hunt, in his case getting debt as a share of economic output falling in five year's time.
Ben Zaranko, an economist with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a non-partisan think-tank, said Hunt's 6.5 billion-pound buffer for meeting his target could be eaten up easily by another freeze in fuel duty and a top-up for the health budget.
""We're on track to meet the - relatively loose, poorly designed - fiscal rule on paper only,"" he said.
Nonetheless, analysts said Hunt and Sunak were probably intending to relax their grip on the public finances between now and the next election, potentially at the cost of Britain's recently restored fiscal credibility.
Andrew Goodwin, at consultancy Oxford Economics, said there was a high risk the OBR's economic forecasts would prove too optimistic, making the job of hitting the five-year debt target even more challenging and raising the temptation to make hard-to-meet, belt-tightening promises out in the future.
""If the Chancellor is put in that situation, and given the timing of the next general election, he would no doubt opt for further austerity measures that take effect in the next parliament,"" Goodwin said.
""It's even more important that the government builds on the measures presented today and produces a more comprehensive plan for boosting growth.""

A breakthrough in the dispute would relieve some of the pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak who has faced the worst run of worker unrest since Margaret Thatcher was in power in the 1980s.

Half a million civil servants, teachers, junior doctors, rail workers and other public sector workers walked out on Wednesday, the government's budget announcement day.
The BBC said the deal that could be reached on Thursday would cover ambulance workers, nurses, midwives and physiotherapists, but not doctors.
The government has said pay rises matching inflation's surge above 10% would be unaffordable and only cause more price rises, further pushing up borrowing costs.
Hunt told Sky News that the pay negotiations were making ""encouraging progress.""

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,Sunak's swimming pool makes a splash in UK budget,Reuters,2023-03-15 18:28:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/V3HGHPRT4FPIPO3LLAILMQE7HI.jpg,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - As British finance minister Jeremy Hunt presented the government's budget in an hour-long speech to Parliament on Wednesday, one tiny announcement made a big splash among opposition lawmakers: new funding for public swimming pools.
Hunt's 63 million pounds of funding for pools came days after a media report about Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the richest-ever occupant of 10 Downing Street, lavishing money on the pool at his private home in northern England.
In the middle of Britain's worst cost-of-living crisis in generations, special equipment had to be installed to provide enough power for Sunak's swimming pool at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, the Guardian newspaper reported.
Early in his budget speech, Hunt touched on the topic of swimming pools and the costs they and other community facilities faced during a time of high energy bills.
""When times are tough, such facilities matter even more,"" he said, but his words were nearly drowned out by raucous laughter from Labour Party lawmakers set off by the mere mention of swimming pools.

Parliament's deputy speaker had to intervene and call for order before Hunt could continue.
Television cameras failed to capture Sunak's reaction, though a reporter for the Daily Mirror said the prime minister maintained a ""masterful poker face.""
Labour leader Keir Starmer said many of Hunt's budget measures were based on ideas proposed by his party, including a cut to fuel duty, which Sunak promoted last year with a photo-shoot using a modest family car that turned out to be borrowed.
""We look forward to the prime minister promoting the swimming pools policy,"" Starmer said. ""Unlike the car, he won’t have to borrow one of those.""

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK employers feel the strain of missing skilled workers,William Schomberg,2023-03-14 10:46:00+00:00,,"BARNSLEY, England, March 14 (Reuters) - Frustrated with England's education system, Simon Biltcliffe spends a lot of time training new hires at his marketing firm in the ""soft skills"" he and many employers say the country's sluggish economy badly needs.
Finding that new starters often struggle to think on their feet, he sets them workplace challenges to learn to solve problems at pace and in teams. Many don't adapt, leading to high attrition after three- and six-month reviews.
Across Britain, Biltcliffe's frustrations are shared by businesses who say the nation's schools, technical colleges and apprentice schemes are not turning out the workers they need, from software coders and designers to skilled machinists.
""There needs to be a step change,"" Biltcliffe said, speaking at the offices of Webmart - which advises clients on the carbon footprint of their marketing operations - in an industrial estate in Barnsley, a former coal town in northern England. Neighbouring businesses include an IT security firm and other companies far removed from the region's mining past.

Biltcliffe described the education system as ""not fit for purpose"" in a changing economy where the growth of automation and artificial intelligence will make creative skills and adaptability all the more important.
While Britain boasts world-leading universities, top scientists and a growing share of young people who continue academic studies after 18, less than a fifth of 25-64 year-olds have a vocational qualification, compared with more than half in Germany, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt is expected to address this skills shortage in a budget statement on Wednesday that he will frame as a growth plan for Britain's economy - still the only one in the Group of Seven yet to recover its pre-coronavirus pandemic size.
But past attempts to train up more workers have seen the problem get worse by some measures, and any big improvement to the post-16 skills system is likely to take years.
The shortage of qualified workers is not unique to Britain but it has been exacerbated by the country's exit from the European Union, which has created more paperwork and cost for employers hiring workers from the bloc. That has contributed to a surge in unfilled vacancies to record levels last year.
Digital roles are growing four times faster than the workforce as a whole, and there are an average of 173,000 vacancies per month for digital occupations, costing the economy tens of billions of pounds each year, according to the government.
Biltcliffe and other employers argue that changes need to be made not only in post-school training, but in schools themselves, which they and some educational campaigners criticise for increasingly promoting memorisation for tests at the expense of creative thinking and practical learning.
The Edge Foundation, which seeks to improve ties between education and employers, says time for subjects such as computing and practical science work has been squeezed over the past decade, and that 71% fewer pupils studied design and technology courses to exam level in 2022 than in 2010.
Subjects that have seen big increases over the past decade included geography and history.
Despite the focus on exams, around 100,000 people leave school every year without required standards in English and maths and Britain has one of the highest rates of young people not in education, employment or training among the world's leading economies.
""We don't do nearly as well for the 50% of school leavers who do not go to university as we do for those who do,"" Hunt said in January.
In response to a question from Reuters about the Edge Foundation data, the education ministry said every state-funded school was ""required to teach a broad and balanced curriculum.""
Without a rapid overhaul of the training system, Britain's pool of highly skilled adults is likely to shrink further relative to other countries, the OECD has warned.
Employers groups are calling on Hunt to tackle a key part of how training is funded in his budget speech.
Since 2017, firms with an annual pay bill of more than 3 million pounds have been required to pay an Apprenticeship Levy - a tax placed in a fund the companies can draw on for training.
Employers say they often cannot find suitable training courses, and over 2 billion pounds of unused funds raised have gone to government coffers.
A House of Commons Library report said in January that the government acknowledged the number of apprenticeships had fallen since the levy was introduced, but argued that the quality of apprenticeships had improved.
The Confederation of British Industry, a business lobby group, wants Hunt to allow firms to invest the money in a wider range of training, not just apprenticeships, citing its own research predicting nine out of 10 British workers will need to retrain by 2030 to adapt to changes in the economy.
The Treasury said on Saturday that Hunt will announce training for older people returning to work that would be more flexible and shorter than other programmes, alongside the expansion of a scheme for reskilling in industries such as construction and technology.
Corporate leaders acknowledge employers also need to do more themselves, and prioritize training even in lean times.
""Training is the first thing that goes when the budget is squeezed,"" Robert West, head of education and skills at the CBI, said.
At Webmart - with 43 staff and annual sales of about 20 million pounds - Biltcliffe says getting new hires up to speed in how to engage with clients or meet deadlines acts as a brake at a time when demands are getting ever more immediate.
""You're slowing down really quite a lot to go at the pace of the education system,"" he said of his company, which began as a print management firm in 1996.
Olly Newton, executive director of the Edge Foundation, says there are bright spots, including schools trying out new ideas.
""I think there's a real head of steam to do something different,"" Newton said.
One such school is the publicly funded XP in Doncaster, 20 miles from Barnsley.
Children joining XP at age 11 immediately go on a trip to the mountains of England or Wales to learn to cope with new challenges and the importance of teamwork.
Inspired by project-based learning schools in the United States, XP sends students out of classrooms to dig into issues such as migration or the impact of the closure of the local mining industry, requiring them to engage with adults and understand the world around them.
""Our students are more reflective than a lot of adults,"" Claira Salter, XP's principal, said. ""Our students can walk into any interview with confidence and talk about themselves.""
By the time they leave XP at 16, all pupils have experience of speaking to groups of 250 people about their work.
Last year, all 50 students who graduated from XP stayed in education or went into employment or training while Doncaster's not in education, employment or training rate for 16-17 year-olds stood at nearly 5% in early 2022.
""We're interested really in things that go on beyond normal school life and equipping kids for their future,"" Salter said.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,"Britain's junior doctors prepare to strike over pay, burnout",Farouq Suleiman,2023-03-13 21:10:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - Fed up with a government he says doesn't care, Poh Wang plans to go on strike with tens of thousands of other British junior doctors next week, saying he is overworked, underpaid and burdened with a student loan he cannot imagine paying off.
The 28-year-old says he and his colleagues have been pushed to the brink after below-inflation pay rises collided with the surging cost of living to leave him questioning how he can ever pay off his more than 85,000 pounds ($101,000) of student debt.
On top of that, he remains incensed at his treatment during the pandemic, when he felt powerless to cope with the onslaught of patients arriving in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms - saying public displays of support did not pay the bills.
He joins junior doctors across England who will go on strike on March 13 for three days, protesting over pay and burnout that risks driving staff out of the health service as it tackles record-high patient waiting lists.

""We've reached a boiling point where we have had enough,"" said Wang - a council member of the British Medical Association (BMA), which represents doctors and medical students.
""The anger is palpable that we have been used and abused and devalued to this extent.""
The son of Chinese immigrants who ran a takeaway restaurant in Chester, northern England, Wang became a doctor because he enjoyed helping people. Having attended medical school for six years, he has worked for five, two in specialty training as a psychiatry doctor.
Junior doctors are qualified physicians, often with several years of experience, who work under the guidance of senior doctors and represent a large part of the country's medical community.
He is paid around 40,000 pounds a year for his base 40 hours a week, and works additional hours which can add up to around 48 hours a week. He rents a room in a shared flat in west London, an option that can cost around 1,000 pounds a month.
Early on in the pandemic, Wang worked as an emergency medicine doctor in south London where he and colleagues had to make difficult decisions, and comfort those patients who could not be admitted into intensive care units because they were full.
""We went above and beyond to do everything that we could,"" he said.
He said the fact that he is struggling to get by financially now, as food inflation hits 17% in Britain, leaves him and his colleagues increasingly bitter about the last few years.
""We hate the sound of clapping, applause, because it's empty,"" said Wang, referring to Britain's Clap for Our Carers campaign for health workers during the height of the pandemic.

""If you value us and what we've gone through and in terms of the sacrifices that we've made then pay us properly.""
The BMA says junior doctors' take-home pay has been cut by more than a quarter over the last 15 years, when using the Retail Price Index (RPI) gauge of inflation.
It says its members voted overwhelmingly to strike.
The walkouts by junior doctors will put more pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) which is experiencing waves of strike action by nurses, ambulance workers and other staff.
Daniel Zahedi, 27, is another junior doctor who plans to go on strike on Monday. He describes his hospital in Cambridge, eastern England, as chronically understaffed and struggling.
""A lot of the time there's not enough of us,"" Zahedi said.
As a first-year doctor after his medical degree, Zahedi said he gets around £29,000 per year as base pay for 40 hours a week minimum. He said he worked roughly 60 hours this week, which was a bit above the average but ""not unusual"". His student loan debt stands at around 100,000 pounds.
""It's not just 100 grand as a student, you've got to pay to be a member of your Royal College, you pay to do exams, to even progress in your career,"" he said.
Zahedi said, as things stand, he cannot see himself remaining in the profession in the long term, despite his love for the job.
""People are burning out left, right and centre - where pay is just getting eroded year after year, where conditions are getting worse, where patient care is being damaged,"" he said.
""They are feeling undervalued and people are leaving.""
In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak outlined the need to cut hospital waiting times as one of his government's five priorities.
Battling strikes across multiple sectors including train drivers and teachers, the government has said public sector pay restraint is needed in order to get double-digit inflation under control.

United States,/world/us/,"Nearly two years later, US Senate confirms Garcetti as ambassador to India",Patricia Zengerle,2023-03-15 23:11:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate confirmed President Joe Biden's nominee Eric Garcetti as ambassador to India on Wednesday, ending a nearly two-year nomination fight over allegations the former Los Angeles mayor mishandled workplace harassment complaints.
Senators backed Garcetti by 52-42, as seven Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in supporting Garcetti and three Democrats joined most Republicans in voting no.
The United States has not had an ambassador to New Delhi since January 2021, an absence that has loomed large as Washington looks to India to be a partner in efforts to push back against China's expanding power and influence.
""The United States-India relationship is extremely important and it's a very good thing we now have an ambassador,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who led a congressional delegation to India last month.

Biden is eager to deepen ties with India, the world's largest democracy and a major U.S. trading partner, as part of his bid to win what he has framed as a contest between free and autocratic societies.
There are an estimated 2.7 million Indian immigrants living in the United States.
However, New Delhi has frustrated Washington by participating in military exercises with Russia and increasing purchases of the country's crude oil, an important source of funding for the war in Ukraine. India is also a major purchaser of Russian military equipment.
Biden nominated Garcetti for the post in July 2021 but he was held up partly due to questions about his handling of allegations of sexual harassment against an aide when he was mayor. Garcetti has denied wrongdoing.
Los Angeles mayor from 2013 until a term limit pushed him from office last year, Garcetti is close to Biden and co-chaired his 2020 presidential campaign.

United States,/world/us/,Grand jury in Georgia heard recording of Trump call to state House speaker -report,Eric Beech,2023-03-16 08:41:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/67JLNO6RRRNF7AVIFXOQQINPEA.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The Atlanta grand jury that probed ex-President Donald Trump's 2020 election meddling heard a taped telephone call he placed to Georgia's Republican House leader seeking to reverse Democrat Joe Biden's victory in that swing state, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on Wednesday.
The existence of such a recording, or that it was played for the 23-member special grand jury during the course of its eight-month investigation, has not been previously reported.
Then-Georgia House Speaker David Ralston, since deceased, told local media in December 2020 that Trump had called him the day before asking him to convene a special session of the state legislature to overturn the presidential election results in Georgia.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said it learned that a recording of the Trump-Ralston call existed from the newspaper's own recent exclusive interview of five of the grand jurors who said they had heard it.
View 2 more stories 
The newspaper quoted one of the panelists it interviewed as saying that Ralston ""basically cut the president off"" without making any specific promises, telling Trump, ""'I will do everything in my power that I think is appropriate.'""
""He just basically took the wind of the sails,"" the juror told the newspaper, recounting that Trump then thanked Ralston, which at that point was ""all the president could say.""
Ralston and other state legislative leaders never called a special session, and the Georgia House speaker himself testified before the special Fulton County grand jury in July 2022, according to local media accounts. Ralston died about four months later, in November.
Unlike evidence and testimony examined in open court by trial juries in the United States, the proceedings of grand juries, which play a role in bringing criminal charges through indictments, are generally closed to the public.
The George elections grand jury also is known to have examined a previously disclosed call Trump made on Jan. 2, 2021, to then-Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger falsely claiming that the November election results were fraudulent.
In a recording of that call, which has been widely available to the public, Trump is heard asking Raffensperger to ""find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state.""
The Wall Street Journal has posted a recording of yet another phone conversation Trump had with Raffensperger's chief investigator at the time, Frances Watson, who was conducting an audit of about 15,000 ballot signatures, urging her to find the ""dishonesty"" that he claimed without evidence had cost him the election.
The Journal-Constitution said the five grand jurors it interviewed - three men and two women - spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their safety and privacy, and declined to discuss parts of its final report that remain under seal.
That report, submitted to the Fulton County district attorney in January before the panel was dissolved, included who the grand jury recommended should be indicted.
In a previous interview with the Journal-Constitution, the jury foreperson, Emily Kohrs, said, ""it's not a short list"" when asked how many individuals the panel recommended be criminally charged.
The special grand jury, unlike a regular grand jury, was not empowered to issue indictments, only recommendations, and the decision on whether to press charges ultimately rests with the district attorney, Fani Willis.

United States,/world/us/,Explainer: How recent lawsuits could affect access to abortion pills,Brendan Pierson,2023-03-16 00:36:00+00:00,,"March 15 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Texas held a hearing on Wednesday in a case seeking to ban the abortion drug mifepristone nationwide, while at least three other lawsuits seek to expand access to it. Below is a guide to what is at stake.
Medication abortion is a two-drug regimen consisting of mifepristone followed by misoprostol used to terminate a pregnancy within the first 10 weeks. Medication abortion, which accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions, has been under increasing scrutiny since the U.S. Supreme Court last June reversed its landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed abortion rights nationwide.
Last November, anti-abortion groups sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in Amarillo, Texas, federal court, claiming that the agency was wrong to approve mifepristone in 2000 because it did not adequately consider its safety. The groups are asking for a preliminary order, or injunction, undoing the FDA's approval while the lawsuit proceeds.
Meanwhile, at least three separate lawsuits were filed earlier this year seeking to expand access to mifepristone.
View 2 more stories 
In February, twelve Democratic state attorneys general sued the FDA to challenge the agency's requirement that doctors who prescribe it, and pharmacies that dispense it, obtain a special certification, arguing those limits were not supported by evidence.
In another lawsuit in West Virginia, generic mifepristone maker GenBioPro is asking a federal judge to block West Virginia, which has a near-total abortion ban, from prohibiting sales of the pills.
In the third lawsuit, a North Carolina doctor is seeking to block that state's restrictions on the drug, which include requirements that it be obtained in person from a physician at specially licensed facilities following mandatory counseling. The state is one of 16 that allow abortion under some circumstances, but impose additional restrictions on mifepristone that make it harder to access.
The West Virginia and North Carolina lawsuits rely on a long-established legal doctrine known as federal preemption, under which federal law - in this case, the FDA's authority to approve and regulate drugs - overrides conflicting state law.
[1/7] Kathy Thomas holds a “abortion is healthcare” sign during the Women's March protest outside of the Federal Courthouse against U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk as he hears a motion by anti-abortion groups led by Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine to pull mifepristone, a drug used in medication abortion, off the market, in Amarillo, Texas, U.S., March 15, 2023. REUTERS/Annie Rice 
A plaintiffs' victory in Texas could completely remove mifepristone from the market nationwide, since federal judges have the power in some cases to issue injunctions that reach beyond their own districts to encompass the whole country. The FDA said in a recent court filing that pulling the drug off the market would dramatically harm patients, forcing them to have unnecessary, and sometimes riskier, surgical abortions and subjecting them to long wait times.
Abortion providers have raised the possibility of prescribing misoprostol alone for medication abortion, which is not a use approved by the FDA but is in some other countries. Such off-label prescribing is generally legal, but it is not clear how many providers would adopt it.
Legal experts say that challenging FDA approval long after the fact on alleged safety grounds has no obvious precedent, and the plaintiffs will need to show a legal reason to overcome the normal six-year statute of limitations.
By filing in Amarillo, however, the plaintiffs have ensured that their case went to U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an outspoken conservative appointed to the federal bench by former Republican President Donald Trump, who has been friendly to conservative causes in past cases.
During Wednesday's hearing, Kacsmaryk thoroughly questioned both sides but did not clearly signal how he would rule. He raised the possibility of a narrower order than the plaintiffs are seeking, which could leave the drugs on the market, but reimpose restrictions lifted by the Biden administration, including a requirement that mifepristone be dispensed in person.
The FDA would seek an emergency stay of any injunction while it appeals to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court is also known as conservative, with a majority of judges appointed by Republicans. But some abortion rights advocates have said they believe it would be more cautious about pulling an FDA-approved drug. Whichever way the 5th Circuit rules, the case is likely to then be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Kacsmaryk said at the March 15 hearing that he would rule as soon as possible.

United States,/world/us/,Wisconsin man pleads guilty to role in plot to kidnap Michigan governor,Tyler Clifford,2023-03-15 18:58:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NYE3WY46PRKLDCOCCYLFUHQH3U.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - A Wisconsin man pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a reduced charge for his role in a foiled plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, handing another victory to prosecutors who have viewed the scheme as domestic terrorism.
Michigan prosecutors accused Brian Higgins, 54, of aiding the conspiracy by surveilling the Democratic governor's vacation home. As part of a plea deal, he admitted in Antrim County court that he attempted to provide material support for terrorism and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement.
Higgins, who faces up to five years in prison, will testify against four men who will go on trial on related charges later this year.
Michael Naughton, an attorney listed for Higgins, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Prosecutors initially charged Higgins with providing material support for a terrorist act, along with the four men who are also accused of firearm violations. The remaining defendants could face 20 years if convicted of the terrorism charge alone.

They are among more than a dozen suspects who were arrested in connection to the plot in October 2020. Last year, seven men were convicted and sentenced for related crimes. Two others were acquitted of charges.
In the previous cases in Jackson County and federal court, prosecutors argued the alleged conspirators were affiliated with right-wing militia groups who opposed public health measures that Whitmer imposed during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group planned to break into Whitmer's vacation home, kidnap her and take her at gunpoint to stand ""trial"" on treason charges, all part of an effort to spark a ""second American Revolution"" prior to a contentious 2020 presidential election, prosecutors said.
Adam Fox, the alleged ringleader, and Barry Croft, Jr., were sentenced to 16 years and more than 19 years, respectively, after being convicted of domestic terrorism, conspiracy to kidnap and other crimes in a second federal trial.
Two others on trial with them were found not guilty in April 2022. The same jury failed to reach a verdict for Fox and Croft, resulting in a mistrial.
Two other men, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, pleaded guilty and cooperated with federal prosecutors. They were sentenced to 2-1/2 years and four years in prison, respectively.
Three other men received sentences of between 7 and 12 years after they were convicted in state court of playing supporting roles in the plot.
This month, Attorney General Nessel said she herself was among potential targets of a man who federal prosecutors say threatened to kill employees of the state of Michigan who are Jewish.

United States,/world/us/,U.S. Copyright Office says some AI-assisted works may be copyrighted,Blake Brittain,2023-03-15 21:49:00+00:00,,"March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Copyright Office issued new guidance on Wednesday to clarify when artistic works created with the help of artificial intelligence are copyright eligible.
Building on a decision it issued last month rejecting copyrights for images created by the generative AI system Midjourney, the office said copyright protection depends on whether AI's contributions are ""the result of mechanical reproduction,"" such as in response to text prompts, or if they reflect the author's ""own mental conception.""
""The answer will depend on the circumstances, particularly how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final work,"" the office said.
The office had no comment on the guidance.
Generative AI systems like Midjourney, ChatGPT and DALL-E, which create text and images in response to human instructions, have recently skyrocketed in popularity. Microsoft-backed OpenAI on Tuesday released GPT-4, an upgraded version of ChatGPT.
View 2 more stories 
The Copyright Office weighed in for the first time last month on whether its output is copyrightable, finding Midjourney-generated images in Kris Kashtanova's comic book ""Zarya of the Dawn"" could not be protected, though Kashtanova's text and unique arrangement of the book's elements could.
The office reiterated Wednesday that copyright protection depends on the amount of human creativity involved, and that the most popular AI systems likely do not create copyrightable work.
""Based on the Office's understanding of the generative AI technologies currently available, users do not exercise ultimate creative control over how such systems interpret prompts and generate material,"" the office said. ""Instead, these prompts function more like instructions to a commissioned artist.""
Creative modifications and arrangements of AI-created work, like Kashtanova's comic, can still be copyrighted, and the office said its policy ""does not mean that technological tools cannot be part of the creative process.""
""In each case, what matters is the extent to which the human had creative control over the work's expression and actually formed the traditional elements of authorship,"" the office said.
The office also said that copyright applicants must disclose when their work includes AI-created material, and that previously filed applications that do not disclose AI's role must be corrected.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Poland to send Ukraine four MiG-29 jets in coming days,Reuters,2023-03-16 14:11:00+00:00,,"WARSAW, March 16 (Reuters) - Poland will send Ukraine four MiG-29 fighter jets in coming days, the president said on Thursday, making it the first of Kyiv's allies to provide such aircraft.
One of Ukraine's staunchest supporters, Warsaw has taken a leading role in persuading sometimes hesitant allies to provide Kyiv with heavy weaponry. It has said that any transfer of jets would be as part of a coalition.
""Firstly, literally within the next few days, we will hand over, as far as I remember, four aircraft to Ukraine in full working order,"" Andrzej Duda told a news conference.
""The rest are being prepared, serviced.""
On Tuesday, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that deliveries could be made in four to six weeks.
Duda said that Poland had roughly 10-20 MiG 29 jets.
NATO allies in the former communist east such as Poland and Slovakia have been particularly vocal supporters of Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.
Slovakia has also been considering whether to send MiG-29s to Ukraine but has yet to reach a decision.

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday that the debate about sending fighter jets was ongoing.
""This is something we're discussing in the group of allied countries. It's a big wish from Ukraine,"" she said.
Poland has sent 14 German-made Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine.
Asked last week how many MiG-29s Warsaw might supply, the head of the president's office, Pawel Szrot, said it would ""certainly not"" be as many as 14.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Branson's Virgin Orbit explores options as cash woes force operational halt,Reuters,2023-03-16 13:59:00+00:00,,"March 16 (Reuters) - Billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit (VORB.O) said it was exploring strategic opportunities and was in talks for potential funding after a cash crunch forced the satellite launch company to pause operations starting Thursday.
The operational halt is expected to continue until March 21, said Virgin Orbit, which has furloughed nearly all its employees, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The furlough is intended to buy the company time to finalize a new investment plan, Chief Executive Dan Hart said in a staff meeting, according to the source.
Shares sank 45% in premarket trading on Thursday, leaving Virgin Orbit with a market capitalization of just around $200 million. That's a far cry from the more than $3 billion valuation the company fetched in 2021 when it went public through a blank-check deal.

The stark drop reflects a downturn in investor appetite for space startups such as Virgin Orbit and Rocket Lab USA (RKLB.O), which saw its stock fall about 70% last year, as well as the challenges faced by these companies in efforts to send their rockets to orbit.
Virgin Orbit in November cut its target for mission launches in 2022. Its rocket LauncherOne in January failed a mission to deploy nine small satellites into lower Earth orbit due to an anomaly during its flight through space.
The company booked a loss of nearly $44 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 and had cash reserves of about $71 million at the time, a sharp drop from $122.1 million as of June-end. It has not announced a date for its fourth-quarter results.
It has since made efforts to boost its cash position; about$10 million was raised last month and a $25 million investment in November from Branson's Virgin Investments - its majority shareholder with a stake of about 75%.

Speaking to French reporters in Hamburg, he did not comment on the scare in the banking sector, but said Airbus is not seeing a surge in the number of firms with problems.
Walter, who is the senior commercial manufacturing executive for Airbus in Germany, said the planemaker ended 2022 with A320-family production of 45 aircraft a month and reiterated plans to introduce the new A321XLR to service in second-quarter 2024. Airbus has sold 560 of its longest-range single-aisle model.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Rheinmetall optimistic for 2023 as defence spending rises,Reuters,2023-03-16 12:02:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CCZTSQKOFBOVBIBIZ53O4UJMDU.jpg,"BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - Rheinmetall (RHMG.DE) expects a strong 2023 after the German defence contractor reported its highest-ever operating result for last year due to the Ukraine war and increased defence spending in Europe.
Rheinmetall said the changes in defence policy had put the group in a promising position in terms of an increase in defence capability, with security-related products in Germany and partner countries.
""The war in Europe has also ushered in a new era for Rheinmetall,"" Chief Executive Armin Papperger said on Thursday.
Papperger told reporters he expected 2023 to be a record year for order intake, with the backlog increasing substantially from the 26.6 billion euros ($28.22 billion) last year due to major orders from military customers.
In particular, the weapon and ammunition division order volume more than doubled in 2022 to nearly 3 billion euros.

Some projects on the horizon include a tank factory in Ukraine, which Papperger expects Kyiv and Berlin to decide on in the next two months, and a weapons factory in eastern Germany set to be decided within weeks.
Rheinmetall could cover about 50% of Ukraine's ammunition needs, Papperger said.
Ukraine's foreign minister this month urged Germany to speed up ammunition supplies, calling shortages the ""number one"" problem in Ukraine, and said manufacturers were ready to deliver but were waiting for the government to sign contracts.
The company, which recently joined Germany's DAX blue-chip index, reported 2022 earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT before special items) of 754 million euros, up 27% compared with the year before and a new record.
The operating profit margin is expected to reach roughly 12% this year after growing to 11.8% in 2022 from 10.5% in 2021.
Sales hit 6.4 billion euros, the company said, confirming preliminary results reported in January that were below Rheinmetall's 2022 outlook.
The company had cited advance investments in its defence business and a slower-than-expected recovery of automotive markets as reasons for the lower than expected outcome.
The company now expects 2023 sales to reach between 7.4 billion and 7.6 billion euros before mergers and acquisition effects, it said.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Boeing issues upbeat jet finance outlook amid market turbulence,Aishwarya Nair,2023-03-15 23:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/Y3VFERF4LJMOBKSXKRDITFNIYI.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) predicted a surge in worldwide aircraft financing towards pre-pandemic levels this year, highlighting a rebound in demand for air travel just as aviation was swept up in a stock market rout over banking sector woes on Wednesday.
The availability of finance for the 1,000 or more new jetliners rolling off production lines each year is a key barometer for the $100-billion-plus a year jet industry, dominated by Boeing and its European rival Airbus (AIR.PA).
But publication of Boeing's widely watched annual forecasts coincided with the loss of billions of dollars of value in planemakers, airlines and travel firms as concerns over Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) washed through global markets.
Any new financial crisis could affect business and consumer confidence and cut demand for premium travel as bankers and other high-value customers rein in spending, putting pressure on airline profitability and jet demand, executives said.
View 2 more stories 
Aviation is also widely seen as vulnerable to any downturn in an economy already scarred by inflation, with United Airlines UAL.O shares falling this week after it signaled demand during off-peak months was waning.
Still, Boeing forecasts drawn up before this week's chill in the banking sector, and published on Wednesday, suggest airlines will absorb $94 billion in delivery funding this year, close to $98 billion seen in 2019 and well above $69 billion last year.
Boeing said it was seeing increased interest from financiers and investors to aid commercial airplane deliveries.
Cash continues to be a significant source of funding as airlines improve their operations and lighten balance sheets stretched by the pandemic. But Boeing said capital markets, bank debt and government export credits would all expand this year.
""This positive trend reaffirms that our industry's fundamentals are strong and aircraft financiers and investors are well positioned as travel continues to recover,"" said Rich Hammond, vice president of Customer Finance at Boeing.
Boeing closed down 4.4% after falling as much as 7% as a slump in Credit Suisse sent shares lower everywhere.
For now, airline executives said, the Credit Suisse upset is viewed as a relatively isolated issue rather than a repeat of the liquidity crisis which rocked aviation and other sectors in 2008-2009.
Boeing's forecast was the first since the planemaker folded decades-old standalone financing arm Boeing Capital into its airplanes unit as part of a corporate streamlining.
Anchored mainly in Dublin, the fast-growing aircraft financing sector has benefited from investors chasing relatively high dollar-denominated returns during the decade of central bank stimulus that followed the global financial crisis.
Financiers at the industry's annual summit in January said ample funds remained for aviation but at tighter conditions, given rising interest rates and a sharper focus on quality.
Leasing firms may face more competition from other sources of finance this year, Boeing predicted in Wednesday's report.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Exclusive: Britain and Japan to pay for most of fighter project agreed with Italy-sources,Nobuhiro Kubo,2023-03-15 15:03:00+00:00,,"TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - Britain and Japan are set to dominate a three-nation project with Italy to build an advanced jet fighter, with Rome set to pay around only a fifth of the overall development cost, two sources said.
Italy's defence ministry said the sources' assessments were ""speculative"", while Britain's Ministry of Defence (MOD) said it ""does not recognise these comments"".
Known as the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), the project is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars before the new jet fighter enters service around the middle of the next decade.
""The cost of the project will likely be around 40% each for Japan and Britain,"" one of the people with knowledge of discussions told Reuters. Both sources, who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to talk to the media, added that most of the programmes details were yet to be decided.
That rough investment breakdown is among the first details to emerge from talks on a high-profile venture that will be a test of whether Japan and Europe can collaborate on major military projects.
View 2 more stories 
Britain's defence ministry said details were still being worked out.
""The MOD does not recognise these comments,"" a spokesperson said. Work on cost-sharing arrangements ""is being conducted before the development phase starts in 2025 and is not yet complete"", the spokesperson added.
The Italian defence ministry said reports about a ""non-equal participation"" in the GCAP programme were ""totally speculative"".
In a statement, it said Italy, Britain and Japan ""are steadily and swiftly working together on a partnership informed by the shared principle of equal partnership as stated"" in December.
Japan's defence ministry said that discussions were ongoing and declined to comment on the cost-sharing ratios.
The defence ministers from the three countries, Japan's Yasukazu Hamada, Britain's Ben Wallace and Italy's Guido Crosetto, will gather in Tokyo on Thursday for their first face-to-face meeting since the fighter deal was agreed in December.
Although the upcoming meeting is not expected to produce any major fresh agreement, it may serve to boost political backing for collaboration.
""GCAP is not going to be a love affair, it's going to be a marriage,"" Wallace said during a speech on Wednesday at the DSEI Japan defence show near Tokyo, which featured a display of the proposed fighter.
Details of which companies would build what components were being hammered out in regular talks between more junior government officials and contractors in Britain, Japan and Italy, the sources said.
Those include Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), which is expected to lead the design with Britain's BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L). Italy's Leonardo Spa (LDOF.MI) is working with Japan's Mitsubishi Electric on the aircraft's sensors, with Rolls Royce PLC working with Japanese jet engine maker IHI Corp (7013.T).
Since its defeat in World War Two, Japan has only ever worked with the United States on big defence projects. But in recent years it has begun to forge security ties with other U.S. allies, including Britain and Australia, as neighbouring China's military power has expanded.
Development of the new advanced fighter from 2025 will be overseen by a joint development organization, the sources said.

In a letter released Friday, Airlines for America, the Air Line Pilots Association, Aerospace Industries Association and others wrote Congress raising ""growing concerns about the urgent need for additional human and technological resources."" They added ""missed certification deadlines, controller staffing shortages, and slow modernization demonstrate that the FAA is not keeping up with the growing needs and complexity of our aviation system.""
The FAA declined comment.

Autos & Transportation,/business/autos-transportation/,"Volkswagen invests in batteries, raw materials in race for affordable EV",Victoria Waldersee,2023-03-14 11:48:00+00:00,,"BERLIN, March 14 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) plans to invest 180 billion euros ($193 billion) over five years in areas including battery production and raw material sourcing in a bid to cut electric vehicle costs and protect its market share, it said on Tuesday.
Over two-thirds of the company's five-year investment budget announced on Tuesday is allocated to electrification and digitalisation, including up to 15 billion for batteries and raw materials.
With markets in turmoil over the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz told analysts however that the company could postpone some battery investments if the market did not grow as expected.
""The overall target is having at all times solid financials,"" Antlitz said.
Volkswagen, Europe's top carmaker, is striving to close a gap with electric vehicle (EV) pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O) by expanding its slice of the growing market for battery-powered cars.
View 2 more stories 
The carmaker is still aiming to bring an affordable EV - costing around 25,000 euros ($26,795) at today's prices - to market by 2025, produced on a second-generation version of its all-electric MEB platform.
Antlitz said he hoped the company would by then have struck enough raw material sourcing deals and expanded battery production to bring down EV costs, 40% of which stem from the cost of the battery.
""We expect to reach 20% electromobility in new sales from 2025 and are already investing two-thirds in that area,"" Antlitz said. ""On the other hand we need to keep combustion engines competitive... that is a double burden.""
The carmaker said it is finalising high-performance software for its premium and luxury brands which could in the medium term be applied across the company, in an attempt to improve operations at its software unit Cariad.
The unit set up under former CEO Herbert Diess has gone over budget and fallen behind on its goals, suffering an operating loss of 2.1 billion euros in 2022 on revenue of 800 million euros, according to the carmaker's annual report released on Tuesday.

Shares in Volkswagen were 2.6% lower by 1122 GMT on Tuesday, with analysts at Jefferies describing the detailed final fourth-quarter results as ""weak"".
Volkswagen met analysts' expectations in 2022 on revenues but missed the consensus estimate for earnings before interest and taxes by 3%.
The investment decisions are targeted towards fulfilling a 10-point plan developed by Volkswagen CEO Oliver Blume after he took the helm in September.
Board member Thomas Schmall said on Monday the carmaker's needs were covered in Europe by the three plants already in the works, and that it was in no rush to pick new sites. It also announced its first North American plant in Canada, due to start production in 2027.
Volkswagen will share the results of a 'virtual equity story' exercise instigated by Blume, which had all of the company's brands from Audi to Bentley prepare for a listing as a training exercise, at a capital markets day on June 21.
The most likely actual stock market candidate is battery unit PowerCo.
All brands had already set profitability and cash flow targets at a summit in January, Blume said, without sharing what these were.
The carmaker this month issued an optimistic outlook for the year ahead that sent shares soaring, forecasting a 10% to 15% rise in revenue on 14% higher deliveries.

Autos & Transportation,/business/autos-transportation/,Exclusive: Tesla taps Asian partners to address 4680 battery concerns,Reuters,2023-03-10 10:59:00+00:00,,"March 10 (Reuters) - It's crunch time at Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), where Elon Musk is looking to crack the code for making better, cheaper batteries.
The electric-vehicle maker is recruiting Chinese and Korean materials suppliers to help lower the cost and boost the energy of its newest battery cells, even as the company struggles with battery-related performance and production issues that have helped delay the launch of its futuristic Cybertruck, according to people familiar with the plans.
Tesla has tapped China's Ningbo Ronbay New Energy (688005.SS) and Suzhou Dongshan Precision Manufacturing (002384.SZ) to help trim materials costs as it ramps up production of 4680 battery cells in the United States, according to the sources, who asked not to be named.
The details of these arrangements have not previously been reported.
If the Austin, Texas-based EV maker is able to work out the performance and process kinks and meet its ambitious production targets, the 4680 ultimately could be the linchpin - rather than choke point - in CEO Musk's dream of building 20 million vehicles annually by 2030.

Neither Tesla nor Musk could be reached for comment.
As part of its efforts, Tesla also has signed a deal with Korea's L&F Co (066970.KQ) to supply high-nickel cathodes that could increase the energy density of its 4680 cells, one of the sources said.
The automaker aims to augment its own output with 4680 cells from Korea's LG Energy Solution (373220.KS) and Japan's Panasonic (6752.T) - an insurance policy to secure future EV production, two of the sources said. LG and Panasonic are expected to supply cells for Cybertruck, one of the sources said.
A shortage of batteries means ""the factories stall,"" Musk told investors in early March.
The new battery is expected to play a key role in the launch late this year of the edgy, stainless-steel Cybertruck, the company's first new model in more than three years.
Tesla had considered three battery options to ensure that launch is not delayed again: smaller 2170 cells used widely in other Tesla models, 4680 cells and less-expensive lithium iron phosphate cells, but the EV maker favored waiting until the 4680 cells are ready, the sources said.
Details about Tesla's Cybertruck battery strategy, including use of 4680 cells and consideration of other options, have not been reported.
In 2022, Musk said he did not expect 4680 batteries would be a ""limiting factor for Cybertruck or anything else.""
The Tesla-designed 4680 cell - so named for its external dimensions (46mm diameter, 80mm length) - is crucial to future production plans. Tesla intends to make versions at factories in Texas, California, Nevada and Berlin for use in vehicles from Model Y to Cybertruck, the sources said.
But Tesla is still struggling to ramp up the first wave of production, Musk acknowledged at Tesla's investor day on March 1.
Despite the immediate problems, some analysts remain optimistic Tesla will resolve these issues.
""While execution risk remains and many details are unknown, Tesla's impact on the global battery industry may still be underestimated,"" Morgan Stanley said after investor day.
Musk first announced the new cell at Battery Day in September 2020. At that event, he promised a 50% reduction in cell cost through a series of innovations, from a larger cell size to a new ""dry"" electrode coating process that could dramatically reduce the size and cost of a battery factory while boosting cell performance.
Repeated delays in moving the new cell from the initial prototype phase to full-scale production also have pushed back introduction of the long-awaited Cybertruck, which was designed to take advantage of the cell's potential improvement in energy density and power - advances that have yet to materialize.
But it will take time for suppliers to ramp up production.
Panasonic is running a pilot 4680 production line at its Wakayama factory in Japan, and plans to start volume production later in the fiscal year that ends in March 2024.
Shoichiro Watanabe, chief technology officer of Panasonic Energy, last month said the company's new Kansas battery plant will focus initially on 2170 cells, but it will eventually shift 4680 production to North America.
Last year, LG said it planned to open a new 4680 production line at its Ochang plant in Korea in the second half of 2023.
Tesla's first-generation 4680 cells, built at its Fremont, California, factory, failed to hit an energy density target, people involved say.
The automaker so far has been able to dry-coat the anode - the negative electrode - but is still having issues with dry-coating the cathode, where the most significant gains are expected to be made, the sources said.
Tesla's attempt to ramp up production of the dry coating process has thus far resulted in enough batteries only for about 50,000 vehicles annually, Musk and company executives have said.
In 2020, Musk said Tesla would have enough 4680 capacity in-house to supply 1.3 million Model Ys.
While executives said it seems likely Tesla will be able to increase 4680 output five-fold by year-end, the company is hedging.
Musk is betting if Tesla ends up with too many batteries this year, that is a good problem to have. It can use those for the energy storage systems it sells to utilities and consumers.
Tesla also has been installing first-generation 4680 cells with ""wet"" cathodes in so-called structural packs in Texas-built Model Ys. A majority of those vehicles use the older 2170 cells.
Tesla plans to use a cathode with more than 90% nickel in the next generation of 4680 cells, two sources said. L&F is expected to be one of the suppliers of that high-nickel cathode, another source said.

Autos & Transportation,/business/autos-transportation/,"Mitsubishi Motors to sell only EVs, hybrids by mid-2030s",Reuters,2023-03-14 00:42:00+00:00,,"TOKYO, March 10 (Reuters) - Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) plans for hybrid and battery electric vehicles to account for all new car sales by the middle of the next decade, beefing up its electrification strategy for staying competitive in key markets.
Mitsubishi, which is also a junior partner in an alliance with France's Renault SA (RENA.PA) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), said it will roll out 16 new models over the next five years.
The Japanese automaker, known for its Outlander sport utility vehicle, stuck to a previous goal of having half of its new car sales electrified by fiscal 2030 and on Friday newly pledged to raise that further to 100% by fiscal 2035.
Mitsubishi considers plug-in hybrids (PHEV), hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as electrified vehicles. Electrified vehicles accounted for about 7% of the company's total new car sales in fiscal 2021.
View 2 more stories 
""Among our existing models, we'll expand the geographical areas where our flagship PHEV Outlander is being offered and build out the sales of the Minicab-MiEV light commercial EV that was relaunched last year,"" Chief Executive Takao Kato said.
Among the 16 new models Mitsubishi plans to roll out, one will be a BEV Renault alliance model, while another will be a Nissan alliance model, Mitsubishi said in presentation materials that were part of its fiscal 2023-2025 business plan.
Mitsubishi, an early mover in EVs in the early 2010s, currently has no BEVs in its line-up in Europe. Its new BEV for Europe would mark a comeback in a highly competitive market where new entrants such as Tesla have already rapidly won market share.
The model could be a variant of the Renault electric MPV Scenic made in France and expected in 2024, or a variant of the Renault electric city cars R5 or R4 expected respectively in 2024 and 2025 and also made in France, a source close to the matter said.
Mitsubishi Europe declined to comment on the matter.
Of the other 14 models Mitsubishi plans to launch, seven will be purely combustion engine-powered ones, five will be hybrids and the remaining two will be BEV, the company said.

Online retailer Amazon had placed an order for 100,000 electric delivery vans (EDVs) from the Irvine, California-based EV maker in 2019, as part of the company's plans to cut carbon emissions. It has taken deliveries and inducted the EDVs into its fleet, with over 10 million packages delivered using the vans.
Amazon informed the EV maker it wanted to buy about 10,000 vans this year, which was at the low end of a range it previously provided Rivian, the report added.
Rivian said it continues to work closely with Amazon. Shares of the EV maker fell around 3% in trading before the bell.
""While nothing has changed with our agreement with Rivian, we have always said we want others to benefit from their technology in the long run,"" said a spokesperson from Amazon.

The company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange between 2007 and 2018.
""We would at some point be keen to come back to markets like London,"" Greenko co-founder Mahesh Kolli said at the Reuters IMPACT climate conference in London on Tuesday.
India's renewable energy capacity is currently around 100 gigawatts. It will need soon to add another 400 gigawatts to achieve its climate goal of half of the nation's energy sourced from renewables by 2030.
Kolli said he saw Greenko supporting this effort, with the company adding 50 gigawatt hours of storage capacity by 2025.

Environment,/business/environment/,"Austria not rowing back support for EU's car CO2 law, minister says",Bart H. Meijer,2023-03-16 10:49:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LYNZOYXY5JINDDNIMPPMCMYNJE.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 16 (Reuters) - Austria has already supported the European Union's agreement on a law to phase out new sales of CO2-emitting cars from 2035, and sees no reason to withdraw its backing for the deal now, Austrian Climate Minister Leonore Gewessler said on Thursday.
The EU's landmark law to accelerate Europe's shift to clean vehicles is currently on hold after Germany declared last-minute opposition, despite EU countries and lawmakers approving a deal on it last year.
""Together with a majority of EU member states we reached a compromise on the transition to admitting only 100% emission-free new cars. I see no reason to change this position. The EU needs to be a reliable partner,"" Gewessler said on her arrival to a meeting of EU environment ministers in Brussels.
Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer last week said he would oppose banning the combustion engine if the debate was escalated to EU country leaders.
View 2 more stories 
An Austrian official confirmed, however, that responsibility for the government's position on the car CO2 law lies with the climate ministry, which already approved the EU deal.
EU country leaders meet in Brussels on Mar. 23-24. The auto CO2 emissions law is not currently on the meeting's agenda.
The EU says the 2035 date is crucial because the average lifespan of new cars is 15 years – so a later ban would stop the EU reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the global milestone scientists say would avert disastrous climate change.
The EU law would not explicitly outlaw combustion engines, but by requiring all new cars sold from 2035 to have zero CO2 emissions, it would make it effectively impossible to sell new combustion engine cars.
Germany, backed by countries including Italy and the Czech Republic, wants assurances that new cars with internal combustion engines could still be sold after 2035, if they run on CO2-neutral fuels, so-called e-fuels.
Some carmakers are also pushing for the exemption, including sports car makers, such as Porsche who see e-fuels as a way to avoid weighing down their high-performance vehicles with batteries.

Environment,/business/environment/,EU lawmakers approve CO2-cutting targets and expanding forest carbon sinks,Kate Abnett,2023-03-14 12:22:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FGTRD665HJMA7KPS7XWFKJINEM.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 14 (Reuters) - The European Parliament gave its final approval on Tuesday to tougher national targets to cut emissions in some sectors, and expand CO2-absorbing natural ecosystems like forests.
The two laws are part of a major package of climate change legislation passing through the European Union's policymaking process, designed to ensure the 27-country bloc cuts greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.
One regulation sets national targets to slash planet-warming emissions in sectors including road transport, heating of buildings, agriculture and waste management.
These sectors, unlike industry and the power sector, are not covered by the EU's carbon market, but generate about 60% of EU greenhouse gas emissions.
The new law aims to curb their emissions 40% by 2030, compared with 2005. It replaces a current target for a 30% cut in these sectors.
View 2 more stories 
Richer countries face tougher targets, with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg and Sweden facing 50% emission cuts, versus Bulgaria's 10% goal. The new law also tightens the amount of emissions savings from past or future years that countries can ""bank"" and ""borrow"" to meet their targets.
""The new rules for national emission cuts ensure that all member states contribute,"" said Jessica Polfjärd, lead lawmaker on the file.
The second law would expand Europe's forests, marshes and other ""sinks"" that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, to ensure this sector removes a net 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030 - a roughly 15% increase from today.
The aim is to reverse a recent decline in Europe's carbon sinks, which can be done by recreating old forests or generating new ones, rewetting peatland or changing farming practices such as reduced tilling to trap more carbon in the soil.
Each EU country would face binding targets to absorb more emissions so that the EU-wide goal is reached.
The EU Parliament approved both laws with a comfortable majority. EU countries will vote on them in the coming months, and if approved, the laws will enter into force.
EU countries and lawmakers agreed the details last year after months of negotiations, so the final votes typically approve laws with no changes.

Environment,/business/environment/,EU agrees to push for fossil fuel phaseout ahead of COP28,Kate Abnett,2023-03-09 19:32:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FGPBEAJVCJPKBNIJLYHA25R3XU.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 9 (Reuters) - European Union countries agreed to promote a global fossil fuel phase out on Thursday ahead of the United Nation's COP28 climate summit this year, attempting to boost a global deal that failed at last year's summit.
Ministers from the 27 EU member states approved a text on their diplomatic priorities ahead of the COP28 summit, which begins on Nov. 30 in Dubai, where nearly 200 countries will attempt to strengthen efforts to rein in climate change.
""The shift towards a climate neutral economy will require the global phase-out of unabated fossil fuels,"" the EU text said, citing the scientific consensus that this is necessary to avoid more severe climate change.
""The EU will systematically promote and call for a global move towards energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels well ahead of 2050"", it said, adding that global fossil fuel consumption should peak in the near term.
View 2 more stories 
Europe is in the midst of transforming its energy system to meet climate targets and end decades of reliance on Russian fossil fuels.
The text said countries should combine the two aims and use renewable energy or energy savings - rather than fossil fuels - to replace Russian energy.
""There is no need for a one-to-one replacement of former Russian natural gas import volumes,"" it said.
Some countries are hoping this year's COP28 summit could clinch a global deal on phasing out CO2-emitting fossil fuels - not only coal, as agreed at previous U.N. climate talks, but also oil and gas.
More than 80 countries, including the EU, supported an Indian proposal to do this at last year's summit, but Saudi Arabia and other oil and gas-rich nations opposed it.
EU countries approved their climate text two weeks later than planned, owing to a spat among countries over whether it should promote nuclear energy.
The final version scrubbed some wording that countries had disagreed on, but said that alongside renewable energy, EU diplomacy will promote sustainable ""low-carbon technologies"" - a phrase that often refers to nuclear energy.

The West Coast is getting pounded by an usually wet season following two decades of drought, creating havoc on roads and endangering blufftop homes along the coast in southern California's Orange County.
""It's been fire to ice and no warm bath in between,"" said Governor Gavin Newsom, referring to the state's pivot from wildfires just a few months ago to one of the snowiest winters on record.
The governor has declared a state of emergency in 43 of California's 58 counties. More than 130,000 homes and businesses remained without power on Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us.
The 11th atmospheric river of the season prompted officials to warn of potential flooding and mudslides from heavy rain, melting snowpack, saturated soils and swollen streams.

By Wednesday afternoon the heavy rainfall associated with the atmospheric river in California had ended, with only light showers persisting in southern California, but forecasters warned of a possible 12th atmospheric river next week.
Atmospheric river describes airborne currents of dense, tropical moisture from the Pacific. A series of them lashed California in rapid succession from late December through mid-January, killing at least 20 people.
Four people have died in the most recent storm, Newsom said while touring flood damage in Pajaro, on the state's central coast, where a levee broke on Saturday, forcing many of the town's 2,000 people, most of them Latino farm workers, to evacuate.
""We're tired. Everybody's tired,"" Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto told the same news conference where Newsom spoke. ""It's hard for some of our most economically impoverished neighbors.""
Monterey County reissued an evacuation order for a 25-mile (40-kilometer) stretch along the Salinas River and Highway 101, most of it low-lying farmland. Numerous coastal and inland roads were closed.
The Sacramento River, the longest in the state, was reaching flood stage just below Shasta Dam, the state's largest reservoir, the National Weather Service said, issuing flood warnings to several towns along the river.

In Tulare County, a farm region in the San Joaquin Valley, the Success Lake reservoir reached its capacity, forcing officials to release water through the Schafer Dam spillway and ordering evacuations downstream.
While agricultural communities got pummeled in the north, wealthy coastal communities took the brunt of the storm in southern California.
In Newport Beach, an upscale Orange County enclave, a home with spectacular ocean views hung in the balance as the blufftop beneath it collapsed.
In nearby San Clemente, blufftop properties were evacuated due to landslides, including one where a backyard swimming pool was left dangling over the precipice.
""It sounded kind of like an earthquake,"" said C.J. Smith, 41, whose home was affected. He acknowledged the dangers that come with living on a bluff above the beach. ""The views are beautiful. To us it's kind of worth the risk.""
Pacific Coast Highway was closed at several points along the Orange County coast.
In the Northeast, a late-winter blizzard dumped about 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow in the Berkshire mountains of western Massachusetts and northwestern Connecticut, and a foot or more in parts of New York's Hudson Valley.
Across Massachusetts the accumulations left by the Nor'easter - a type of storm that affects the U.S. East Coast and is named after the direction of the wind - varied greatly. In Colrain, a town of 1,700 in the northwestern part of the state near the Vermont border, 3 feet (91 cm) of snow was on the ground, while Boston's suburbs had about an inch.

India's weather department has warned key growing states in central, northern, and western regions could receive more rain and hailstorms in the next 10 days. That could curtail production and lift food inflation, which the government and central bank have been trying to contain.
A drop in wheat production could make it difficult for New Delhi to replenish inventories, while lower rapeseed output could force the world's biggest edible oils buyer to increase imports of palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil.
""Rainfall and hailstorms are raising concerns, since harvesting of winter crops just started. The standing crops would be affected, and it could reduce the output,"" said Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India Pvt Ltd.

Farmers usually start planting wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas in October and November, and harvest them from the end of February.
Hailstorms and gusts of more than 30 kilometre per hour winds could hit states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra in the next few days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.
Winter-sown crops have already been under stress because of above-normal temperatures and maturing early, said farmer Ramrai Bohara from Rajasthan, the biggest rapeseed producing state.
The maximum temperature in some wheat growing areas jumped above 39 degrees Celsius earlier this month, nearly seven degrees Celsius above normal, according to weather department data.
""We don't want rainfall and windy weather for two-three weeks. Crops would fall and harvesting will become difficult,"" Bohara said.
Rainfall would not only reduce yields but could also reduce the quality of the harvest, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

India's weather department has warned key growing states in central, northern, and western regions could receive more rain and hailstorms in the next 10 days. That could curtail production and lift food inflation, which the government and central bank have been trying to contain.
A drop in wheat production could make it difficult for New Delhi to replenish inventories, while lower rapeseed output could force the world's biggest edible oils buyer to increase imports of palm oil, soyoil and sunflower oil.
""Rainfall and hailstorms are raising concerns, since harvesting of winter crops just started. The standing crops would be affected, and it could reduce the output,"" said Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India Pvt Ltd.

Farmers usually start planting wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas in October and November, and harvest them from the end of February.
Hailstorms and gusts of more than 30 kilometre per hour winds could hit states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra in the next few days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.
Winter-sown crops have already been under stress because of above-normal temperatures and maturing early, said farmer Ramrai Bohara from Rajasthan, the biggest rapeseed producing state.
The maximum temperature in some wheat growing areas jumped above 39 degrees Celsius earlier this month, nearly seven degrees Celsius above normal, according to weather department data.
""We don't want rainfall and windy weather for two-three weeks. Crops would fall and harvesting will become difficult,"" Bohara said.
Rainfall would not only reduce yields but could also reduce the quality of the harvest, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading house.

Environment,/business/environment/,"Floods kills at least 10 in southeast Turkey, Anadolu says",Reuters,2023-03-15 14:18:00+00:00,,"ISTANBUL, March 15 (Reuters) - At least 10 people have been killed after torrential rains triggered flash floods in Turkey's southeastern Sanliurfa and Adiyaman provinces, the state-owned Anadolu news agency reported on Wednesday.
Floodwater carried away cars and debris and inundated the basement and ground floors of some buildings, turning roads into rivers in central Sanliurfa, footage from social media and local broadcasters showed.
Search and rescue efforts for the missing and people trapped in their buildings continued with divers and boats, the country's disaster management authority (AFAD) said.

It said that more than 100 millimetres per square metre of rain had fallen in the affected provinces in the last 24 hours.
The provinces, home to some 2.7 million people, were hit by last month's earthquakes which killed more than 48,000 people in Turkey and left millions homeless.

Environment,/business/environment/,Shell rules out more ambitious goal for end-user emissions,Ron Bousso,2023-03-16 13:48:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SMV6KBZL2RJJHM6UK7IINPXNVM.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Shell (SHEL.L) has ruled out setting targets to cut emissions in absolute terms from customers' use of its products, its chair said in a report published on Thursday as the energy company faces increased activist and investor pressure over climate.
End-user emissions, referred to as Scope 3, account for about 95% of the energy company's greenhouse gas pollution and some investors have urged Shell to introduce medium-term targets to reduce them in absolute terms.
""The Board has considered setting a Scope 3 absolute emissions target but has found it would be against the financial interests of our shareholders and would not help to mitigate global warming,"" Shell Chairman Andrew Mackenzie said in the report.
Shell said that such Scope 3 targets would force it to reduce sales of oil products and natural gas, ""effectively handing over customers to competitors"".
View 2 more stories 
The rejection of the tougher emission reduction targets comes after Shell's new chief executive, Wael Sawan, signalled this month that the company was reviewing plans for a gradual reduction to oil output.
Shareholders will vote on May 23 on a resolution filed by activist group Follow This, which asked Shell to set 2030 emissions reduction goals in line with the 2015 Paris U.N. accord on climate change.
Shell's board has yet to issue a recommendation, but it has previously recommended that similar resolutions be opposed by investors. Last year's resolution won the backing of 20% of the votes while Shell's energy transition strategy received 80% backing.
Shell aims to cut planet-warming gases across its portfolio - based on the emissions intensity of its fuels - by 20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050. From a 2016 base it aims to halve emissions from its own operations on an absolute basis by 2030 and said it has already reduced them by 30%.
Measuring emissions by intensity means a company can technically increase its fossil fuel output and overall emissions while using offsets or adding renewable energy or biofuels to its product mix.
A Dutch court in 2021 ordered Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030. The company has appealed against the verdict.
A group of European institutional investors is also backing a London lawsuit targeting Shell's board over alleged climate mismanagement in a case that could have far-reaching implications on how companies tackle emissions.
""We believe our directors have complied with their legal duties and have, at all times, acted in the best interests of the company,"" Shell said in its report in response to the lawsuit.
Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% from 2019 levels by 2030 to have any hope of limiting global warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), the level scientists say can prevent the most severe consequences.

Environment,/business/environment/,U.S. proposes limits for cancer-causing chemicals in drinking water,Valerie Volcovici,2023-03-14 22:40:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed the first-ever national drinking water standard for six cancer-causing chemicals known as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).
The proposal is a major milestone in the EPA's strategy to tackle the human-made so-called ""forever chemicals"" found in water, air and food that have caused tens of thousands of illnesses around the country.
""EPA’s proposal to establish a national standard for PFAS in drinking water is informed by the best available science, and would help provide states with the guidance they need to make decisions that best protect their communities,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.
Under the new standard, the agency will require public water systems to monitor for six PFAS chemicals, inform the public if PFAS levels exceed proposed standards in the drinking water supply, and take action to reduce PFAS levels.
Chemical companies sell PFAS for use in products ranging from paper to pans, enabling them to be stain-resistant, water-repellent and grease-proof. They are also used in industrial processes and discharged into waterways.

The Biden administration has directed $10 billion to help communities reduce PFAS and other contaminants through passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
It is the first time since 1996 that drinking water standards have been proposed for a new chemical under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
Environmental groups welcomed the new standards but said it was up to retailers and chemical companies to make a difference.
“This action should send a strong signal to retailers that it’s time to phase out all PFAS to prevent further drinking water contamination of communities around the country,” said Mike Schade, director of Toxic-Free Future's Mind the Store program.
West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito, who has for years pressed the EPA to address PFAS, welcomed the announcement and said she wanted to hear from water systems and ratepayers about how the standards would affect them and how Congress can help.
""I’m looking forward to hearing from those who will be impacted by this announcement, including local water systems and ratepayers across the country, on how we can provide assistance for implementation,"" she said.

Environment,/business/environment/,Diageo boss warns on Scottish water shortage,Richa Naidu,2022-10-04 10:46:00+00:00,,"LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Diageo PLC's (DGE.L) Chief Executive Ivan Menezes believes Scotland could face a water shortage due to climate change unless businesses and lawmakers act, he said at the Reuters Impact conference on Monday.
The threat in Scotland, where Diageo is the biggest exporter of Scotch whisky through brands like Johnnie Walker, depends on how successful the world is at averting climate change and hitting a 1.5-degree Celsius limit on global warming, he said.
""There are scenarios where we could see water being stressed in Scotland,"" Menezes said.
Diageo's beer business manufacturing Guinness stout consumes more water than spirits, he added.
Menezes said that part of his compensation is tied to Diageo hitting specific environmental goals including on water conservation.
Diageo also makes Don Julio tequila, Smirnoff Vodka and Baileys liqueur.
Separately, Menezes said that Diageo is ""not immune"" to inflationary pressure and soaring energy costs but ""should be OK"" if Europe faces energy blackouts as soon as tomorrow.

Russia's war on Ukraine has driven energy prices to record highs, hitting Europe particularly hard because of its dependence on Russian gas.
""We should be well-covered,"" he said.
Diageo sees water conservation and environmental efforts as ""really core to the long-term health of the business,"" Menezes said.
""We're a consumer business so it will translate into consumer preference over time,"" Menezes said. ""We have a strong conviction about that.""
The company is replenishing water in stressed areas it operates in, including in India by 2024.
The spirits industry has managed to avoid taking a hit from an ongoing cost-of-living crisis in Europe. Diageo recently reported strong sales of its most expensive products.
The company said during its earnings call in July that its products were selling because people consider them an occasional indulgence, even as high inflation stoked by Russia's war with Ukraine shows no signs of abating.

Environment,/business/environment/,"London mayor Sadiq Khan urges green investment, snipes at Truss policies",Gloria Dickie,2022-10-19 21:50:00+00:00,,"LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The mayor of London urged business leaders on Monday to invest in climate solutions, saying the British capital would need another 75 billion pounds ($84.05 billion) in investment to meet its climate goals.
Noting infrastructure crippled by extreme heat to homes damaged in wildfires, Sadiq Khan warned that ""no one will be able to claim with any credibility that we were not given fair warning.""
Taking aim at the new conservative government of Prime Minister Liz Truss, the mayor said that ""while the doors of Whitehall might be closing to climate action, the doors of City Hall will remain wide open for as long as I'm in office.""
Since taking office, Truss has reversed a ban on drilling for natural gas and announced fiscal plans to cut the highest rate of income tax - a policy the government reversed on Monday - as part of a package of financial measures that last month sent sterling and British government bonds into meltdown.
Khan said during his opening address at the Reuters IMPACT climate conference in central London that his city was working to reach net-zero emissions by 2030 to ""avoid a catastrophic climate crisis."" The city's activities include investing in green jobs and infrastructure, decarbonising buildings, opening more cycling lanes to discourage driving and promoting electric vehicles.

But London would need more help, he said.
""In excess of 75 billion pounds of investment is needed,"" Khan said. ""We simply cannot deliver this without the private sector.""

Options volume on Credit Suisse jumped to 597,000 contracts, more than 27 times its daily average, and was set to hit a record 792,000 contracts by the end of the session, according to data from options analytics firm Trade Alert. That made Credit Suisse the fourth most heavily traded single-stock name in the U.S. options market on Wednesday.
The surge in trading followed a near 31% tumble in Credit Suisse shares on Wednesday after Saudi National Bank (SNB) (1180.SE), which holds 9.88% of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), said it would not buy more shares on regulatory grounds.
Trading in Credit Suisse puts outnumbered that in its call options 1.7-to-1. Puts convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and are typically employed to express bearish sentiment, while calls offer the right to buy shares at a set price in the future and usually express bullish bias.

Still, market participants said massive volume and various cross-currents made it difficult to get a read on which way the bulk of investors were betting.
""There's a lot of moving parts in the Credit Suisse trade right now with respect to a major credit event, European bank contagion, and the possibility of ECB intervention,"" said Steven Place, an independent options trader in Destin, Florida.
""That means you're going to see multiple kinds of bets in play,"" he said, noting that some traders may be trying to take advantage of the heightened volatility while others might even be looking to place bets on a quick rebound in the bank's battered shares.
U.S. listed options on other European banks Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), and UBS Group (UBSG.S), also surged, with much of the trading flow leaning toward defensive put contracts, Trade Alert data showed.
Credit Suisse' woes rekindled worries about the outlook for U.S. bank stocks, which have come under pressure in recent days following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVBV.UL) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O).
The S&P 500 Banks Index (.SPXBK) was down 4.2% on Wednesday and trading in the options on Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF.P) showed a bearish bias, according to Trade Alert data.

Finance,/business/finance/,"Factbox: FACTBOX Credit Suisse's troubles - spies, money laundering and central bank cash",Reuters,2023-03-16 10:44:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/N5GCVCF675KBDEDUZ2GW266ALE.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) is to borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to bolster liquidity and reassure investors after its shares slumped on fears of contagion from a banking crisis in the United States.
The central bank lifeline is expected to give the Swiss bank time to carry out a major overhaul it had already embarked on in 2022 to recover from a string of scandals, losses and lawsuits.
Here are some of the crises the bank has faced in the past few years (in reverse chronological order):
Credit Suisse in March 2023 had to tap the Swiss central bank for up to $54 billion to shore up liquidity and investor confidence, after its shares slumped to record lows in the wake of a bank collapse in the United States that triggered fears of bank runs around the world.
The Zurich based bank became the first major global bank to be thrown an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis.

Credit Suisse led a selloff in bank shares in Europe after its largest investor Saudi National Bank (1180.SE) said it could not provide more financial assistance because of regulatory constraints.
Credit Suisse's 2022 annual report identified ""material weaknesses"" in internal controls over financial reporting.
Auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers included in the report an ""adverse opinion"" on the effectiveness of the bank's internal controls over its reporting but its statements ""present fairly, in all material respects"" the financial position of the bank in 2020 through 2022.
Swiss regulator FINMA said the bank must have appropriate control processes in place.
Credit Suisse in February 2023 reported a total net loss of more than 7 billion Swiss francs for 2022, its biggest loss since the 2008 financial crisis and it warned of a ""substantial"" loss for 2023.
The bank saw an acceleration in withdrawals in the fourth quarter of 2022, with outflows of more than 110 billion Swiss francs, but it said the picture had been improving.
In June, the bank was convicted of failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang.
The court found deficiencies within Credit Suisse regarding both its management of client relations with the criminal organisation and its monitoring of the implementation of anti-money laundering rules.
Both Credit Suisse and the convicted former employee had denied wrongdoing. Credit Suisse said it would appeal the conviction.
A Bermuda court ruled in March 2022 that former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and his family are due damages of more than half a billion dollars from Credit Suisse's local life insurance arm.
The court said Ivanishvili and his family were due the damages as a result of a long-running fraud committed by a former Credit Suisse adviser, Pascale Lescaudron.
Lescaudron was convicted by a Swiss court in 2018 of having forged the signatures of former clients, including Ivanishvili, over an eight-year period.
Credit Suisse has said it expects the case, which it is appealing, to cost it around $600 million.
Credit Suisse denied allegations of wrongdoing after dozens of media outlets in February 2022 published results of coordinated, Panama Papers-style investigations into a leak of data on thousands of customer accounts in previous decades.
Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned in January 2022 after flouting COVID-19 quarantine rules.
The abrupt move came less than a year after Horta-Osorio was brought in to clean up the bank's corporate culture marred by its involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos and insolvent supply-chain finance firm Greensill Capital.
Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion when U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management defaulted in March 2021.
The hedge fund's highly leveraged bets on certain technology stocks backfired and the value of its portfolio with Credit Suisse plummeted.
An independent report into the incident criticised the bank's conduct, saying its losses were the result of a fundamental failure of management and control at its investment bank, and its prime brokerage division in particular.
Credit Suisse was forced to freeze $10 billion of supply chain finance funds in March 2021 when British financier Greensill Capital collapsed after losing insurance cover for debt issued against its loans to companies.
Swiss regulators have rebuked Credit Suisse for ""serious"" failings in its handling of the multi-billion dollar business with Greensill.
Credit Suisse shareholders rejected a proposal from the bank's board to discharge management from other liabilities for 2020, highlighting investor anger at the bank's costly missteps.
Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was forced to quit in March 2020 after an investigation found the bank hired private detectives to spy on its former head of wealth management Iqbal Kahn after he left for arch rival UBS (UBSG.S).
Switzerland's financial regulator said Credit Suisse had misled it about the scale of the spying. The regulator said the bank planned seven different spying operations between 2016 and 2019 and carried out most of them.
In response, Credit Suisse said it condemned the spying and had taken ""decisive"" steps to improve its governance and strengthen compliance.

The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's request for information marks the latest move from the regulator to explore how various firms use personal financial data, and could inform future rulemaking, the CFPB said in a release.
In one of his first moves as CFPB director in 2021, Rohit Chopra ordered Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc to hand over information about how they gather and use consumer payment data.
“Modern data surveillance practices have allowed companies to hover over our digital lives and monetize our most sensitive data,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in a statement. “Our inquiry will inform whether rules under the Fair Credit Reporting Act reflect these market realities.”

Finance,/business/finance/,Credit Suisse's $54 billion lifeline gives global banks tentative respite,John Revill,2023-03-16 13:46:00+00:00,,"March 16 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) sought to shore up its liquidity and restore investor confidence on Thursday by borrowing up to $54 billion from Switzerland's central bank, after a slide in its shares intensified fears of a global banking crisis.
Shares in Credit Suisse briefly bounced from a 25% fall on Wednesday after its statement, which came in the middle of the night in Zurich, but then faded and last traded 20% higher.
Europe's banking index (.SX7P) initially rose, but was down 0.3% by 1306 GMT, after days of heavy losses on investor fears over potential bank stresses across the world, which have also prompted calls for action by companies in other sectors.
Since March 8, before last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) European banks have lost around $165 billion in market value, Refinitiv data shows.
Credit Suisse is the first major global bank to be thrown an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis and its troubles have raised serious doubts over whether central banks will be able to sustain aggressive interest rate hikes.

However, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday as promised, underscoring the resilience of the euro area banking sector while assuring it had plenty of tools to offer liquidity support if needed.
The ECB said it was ""monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area"".
Policymakers have stressed that the situation now is different to the global financial crisis as banks are better capitalised and funds more easily available.
Allianz (ALVG.DE) one of Europe's biggest financial firms, said that authorities were ""well equipped"" to deal with any liquidity crisis, ""unlike what happened during"" the global financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.
Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would exercise an option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank, which confirmed it would provide liquidity to Credit Suisse against sufficient collateral.
The move followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met ""the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"".
Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner told Credit Suisse staff in a memo they should focus on facts as he pledged to rapidly move forward with a plan to streamline operations.
Credit Suisse would continue to focus on the transformation from a position of strength, Koerner said, citing an improved liquidity coverage ratio and recent capital increases.
The bank's stock market value has fallen by 90% since its peak in February 2007 of around $91 billion, to around $8.66 billion following a prolonged slide in its shares.
Analysts said that the measures will buy Credit Suisse time to carry out its planned restructuring, although there could well be further moves to pare back the Swiss lender.
""We would not exclude the possibility of further restructuring statements from management designed to further simplify the bank,"" Thomas Hallett at KBW said in a note.
As its shares regained some ground, the cost of insuring exposure to Credit Suisse debt tumbled from record highs, while insurance protection on bonds issued by BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and UBS also inched back down.
Swiss media reported that Switzerland's cabinet would hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the situation. The government declined to comment.
Stocks had wallowed in the red as investors rushed to the relative ""safe havens"" of gold, bonds and the dollar through most of the Asian day. While Credit Suisse's announcement helped trim some losses, trade was volatile and sentiment fragile.
Credit Suisse bankers contacted clients in Asia to reassure them after the latest inflow of funds.
""We've been telling them to read the statements and look at the fact that we are buying 3 billion francs worth of bonds because they are so cheap,"" said a Hong Kong-based senior banker, who declined to be named.
The 167-year-old bank's problems have shifted the focus for investors and regulators from the U.S. to Europe, where Credit Suisse led a bank share sell-off after its largest investor said it could not provide more funds due to regulatory constraints.
The concerns about Credit Suisse added to broader fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank, two U.S. mid-size firms.
Investors are focused too on any action by central banks and other regulators elsewhere to restore confidence.
Policymakers in Australia and South Korea sought to reassure markets that banks in their jurisdictions were well-capitalised.
SVB's demise last week, followed by that of Signature Bank two days later, sent bank stocks on a roller-coaster ride as investors feared another collapse like Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street giant whose failure sparked the global financial crisis.
The exit for the doors raised fears of a broader threat to the financial system, and two supervisory sources told Reuters that the ECB had contacted banks on its watch to quiz them about their Credit Suisse exposures.
The U.S. Treasury also said it was monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and was in touch with global counterparts.
Rapidly rising interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders already worried about a recession.
Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve, which last week was expected to accelerate its interest rate hikes in the face of persistent inflation, may hit pause or reverse course.

A source with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters that the total exposure in Spain was well below 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), without elaborating.
Credit Suisse in Spain declined to comment.
Delgado, who did not give any figure, said that it was necessary to strengthen corporate governance as unexpected shocks could not be entirely avoided.
""It was one of the lessons learned during the major global financial crisis and since then, the European and Spanish financial system has made great progress to improve it,"" Delgado said. ""Crises traditionally reveal failures in the governance and management of different risks.""

Another source said that Spanish lenders have been reducing their exposure especially over the last year-and-a-half after a string of scandals at the Swiss lender, such as the collapse of U.S. investment firm Archegos in 2021.
After a slump in its shares intensified fears on Wednesday about a global banking crisis, Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) sought to shore up its liquidity and restore investor confidence on Thursday by borrowing up to $54 billion from the Swiss central bank.
Delgado said that recent market turmoil should reinforce the importance of global supervisory, regulation and resolution efforts, stressing it was important to ""complete the banking union (...) and implement the missing pillar,"" such as the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS).
Delgado also said that the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) would be unlikely in Europe as the business model of SVB was not comparable to that of European banks.
Whereas in Spain on average 66% of deposits are guaranteed, in the case of SVB just 11% were guaranteed, Delgado said.
On Thursday, the head of Spanish banking association AEB Alejandra Kindelan said at moments of high volatility the market was not making any distinctions.

Delgado said that recent market turmoil should reinforce the importance of global supervisory, regulation and resolution efforts, stressing it was important to ""complete the banking union (...) and implement the missing pillar,"" such as the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS).
Delgado also said that the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) would be unlikely in Europe as the business model of SVB was not comparable to that of European banks.
Whereas in Spain on average 66% of deposits are guaranteed, in the case of SVB just 11% were guaranteed, Delgado said.
On Thursday, the head of Spanish banking association AEB Alejandra Kindelan said at moments of high volatility the market was not making any distinctions.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,Alzheimer's Association lobbies for Medicare coverage of Leqembi and other drugs,Ahmed Aboulenein,2023-03-16 10:44:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GPRRBUUMYZMUHKDBXTD4ACFJRQ.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 16(Reuters) - The Alzheimer's Association has deployed 1,000 people diagnosed with, or caring for someone with the disease, to meet with all 535 members of Congress across the United States and urge them to press Medicare for early access to a new class of drugs, beginning with lecanemab, that promise to slow the disease.
The grassroots lobbying campaign, which has not been reported in detail, is being led by state-based chapters, according to interviews with four Association national and local officials.
The effort is aimed at persuading the Medicare health program for people aged 65 and older to provide ""full and unrestricted coverage"" to the drugs when they first reach the U.S. market under an accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Broad coverage of the drugs would mean substantially more revenue for the drug makers. Some analysts project 2023 sales of lecanemab, also known as Leqembi, could reach between $26 million and $70 million. Other analysts have forecast sales as high as $5 billion by 2030 if the drug gets broad coverage this summer.

The Alzheimer's Association and the pharmaceutical industry say the drug companies are not directly involved in the campaign.
Wider Medicare coverage will become available once the drugs receive full commercial approval from the FDA, a process that requires more data from drugmakers and that could take several months.
But the Alzheimer's Association says patients simply don't have the time to spare. It estimates hundreds of thousands of elderly people with mild dementia may progress to a more advanced stage of the disease during that time, and will no longer be eligible for the new treatments.
""Treatments taken in the early stages of Alzheimer’s would allow people more time to participate in daily life, remain independent and make health care decisions for their future,"" Alzheimer’s Association President Joanne Pike said.
CMS said its framework includes a broader coverage pathway if the drugs receive standard FDA approval.
""CMS is committed to being nimble when reconsidering this coverage framework in light of any new evidence related to the clinical benefit of this drug, and we continue to encourage clinicians, patients and caregivers to send us relevant evidence,"" an agency spokesperson told Reuters.
The agency did not address the Alzheimer's Association campaign.
The first of the new drugs, Japan's Eisai Co and Biogen Inc's (BIIB.O) drug Leqembi, won FDA approval in January under an accelerated review process, after the drug showed some evidence in trials that it could slow the advance of Alzheimer's in early stages of the disease. Eisai priced the drug at $26,500 a year.
The FDA is expected to give full approval this summer. Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY.N) drug donanemab is expected to be considered for full approval later this year.
Eisai and Biogen said this week that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) will provide coverage of Leqembi provided veterans request it, receive prior approval, and meet strict inclusion criteria.
Leqembi belongs to a new generation of treatments designed to slow advance of the disease by removing sticky clumps of the toxic protein beta amyloid from the brain.
An estimated 6.5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. It is the fifth leading cause of death for adults over 65.
Over the past two months, chapters have tweeted, written letters and met congressional staffers and lawmakers, calling on them to apply pressure on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand drug coverage.
The association's Southeast Florida chapter launched its lobbying drive a few weeks before the FDA granted accelerated approval to Leqembi. Association members have met 30 times with staffers for the state's 20 members of Congress, Ryan Schiff, the chapter's public policy manager, said.
In California, Myra Garcia, 64, whose career as a fundraiser was cut short by her diagnosis in 2020, said she met with staffers for seven members of Congress from the state.
""It was quite a flurry of meetings, one after another, and, to a person, there is not a person who said that they would not sign on to the ask,"" Garcia told Reuters. ""There was one day where I think I hit five meetings.""
Nearly 100 lawmakers from both parties, including Republican Senator Susan Collins from Maine, a founder of the congressional task force on Alzheimer's, have signed a letter urging HHS and Medicare to expand coverage.
Myra Garcia, 64, whose career as a fundraiser was cut short by her diagnosis in 2020, said she met with staffers for seven members of Congress representing California.
""It was quite a flurry of meetings, one after another, and, to a person, there is not a person who said that they would not sign on to the ask,"" Garcia told Reuters. ""There was one day where I think I hit five meetings.""
The Alzheimer's Association received $4.5 million in funding from the pharmaceutical industry in 2022, including a combined $1.34 million from Biogen, Eisai, and Eli Lilly, makers of the new drugs.
The Association says on its website that the funding represents just over 1% of its overall revenue of $425 million and that the donations do not impact decision making.
Spokespeople for all three companies said they do not work with the Association on its campaign to expand Medicare coverage of the drugs.
While there is no direct connection between drug company support for the Association and its activities, the campaign ""falls in a gray area,"" said Edward Walker, University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) sociologist who studies how companies mobilize grassroots campaigns.
""Sometimes it's part of a long game strategy,"" Walker said. ""They fund a lot of these patient advocacy groups because they know that in the long term that support is going to come back around and help them.""

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,"Exodus of healthcare workers from poor countries worsening, WHO says",Emma Farge,2023-03-14 22:55:00+00:00,,"GENEVA, March 14 (Reuters) - Poorer countries are increasingly losing healthcare workers to wealthier ones as the latter seek to shore up their own staff losses from the COVID-19 pandemic, sometimes through active recruitment, the World Health Organization said on Tuesday.
The trend for nurses and other staff to leave parts of Africa or Southeast Asia for better opportunities in wealthier countries in the Middle East or Europe was already under way before the pandemic but has accelerated since, the U.N. health agency said, as global competition heats up.
""Health workers are the backbone of every health system, and yet 55 countries with some of the world's most fragile health systems do not have enough and many are losing their health workers to international migration,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general.
He was referring to a new WHO list of vulnerable countries which has added eight extra states since it was last published in 2020. They are: Comoros, Rwanda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, East Timor, Laos, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.

Jim Campbell, director of the WHO's health workforce department, told journalists safeguards for countries on the WHO list were important so they ""can continue to rebuild and recover from the pandemic without an additional loss of workers to migration"".
Some 115,000 healthcare workers died from COVID around the world during the pandemic but many more left their professions due to burnout and depression, he said. As a sign of the strain, protests and strikes have been organised in more than 100 countries since the pandemic began, he added, including in Britain and the United States.
""We need to protect the workforce if we wish to ensure the population has access to care,"" said Campbell.
Asked which countries were attracting more workers, he said wealthy OECD countries and Gulf states but added that competition between African countries had also intensified.
The WHO says it is not against migration of workers if it was managed appropriately. In 2010, it released a voluntary global code of practice on the international recruitment of health personnel and urges its members to follow it.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,U.S. FDA expands authorization of Pfizer bivalent COVID-19 shots in kids,Reuters,2023-03-14 23:14:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VQGQQF4YDNLY5HMDUIH27DNMSQ.jpg,"March 14 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had expanded the emergency use authorization (EUA) of the company and its partner BioNTech SE's (22UAy.DE) bivalent COVID-19 vaccine as a single booster dose in certain children.
The amended authorization is for children six months through four years of age who have completed their initial three-dose vaccination with Pfizer's original shot.
In December, the U.S. health regulator had authorized Pfizer/BioNTech's updated shot as a third dose to those aged six months through four years, who have not completed their primary vaccination series or are yet to receive the third dose.
The health regulator's amended authorization is based on data from 60 children, from the expanded age group, who completed primary vaccination with three doses and received a booster shot of Pfizer/BioNTech, and showed an immune response to both the original SARS-CoV-2 virus strain and to Omicron BA.4/BA.5.
View 2 more stories 
Shots for youngest children in the United States were only approved in June last year, making them the last group to become eligible for vaccination.
Government data shows that only 2.7% children under the age of two and less than 5% of children aged two to four years who are eligible have completed their primary vaccination series as of Nov. 30, representing a slow uptake of the initial vaccine doses in young children.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,"Novo Nordisk to slash US insulin prices, following move by Eli Lilly",Patrick Wingrove,2023-03-14 18:37:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/S5KRGMJWWZIODB4BZYJ4W73ETE.jpg,"March 14 (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) said on Tuesday it would cut U.S. list prices for several insulin products by up to 75% next year, joining rival Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) as political pressure mounts to make these life-sustaining diabetes treatments more affordable.
The moves follow the passing of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act last year that capped insulin prices for Medicare recipients at $35 per month, but does not include patients without insurance.
Around 8.4 million of the 37 million people in the United States with diabetes use insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association.
Although insulin list prices are high in the U.S., drugmakers typically pay substantial rebates to private insurers and government programs, resulting in lower prices for most Americans with insurance.
Uninsured people sometimes have to pay the full list prices, forcing some to ration or skip taking their medicine.

Biden said in a statement that he was pleased by Novo's move and urged other manufacturers to follow suit.
The Danish drugmaker will reduce the list price of its NovoLog insulin by 75%, and for Novolin and Levemir by 65%. The company said the financial impact of the move was uncertain.
U.S.-listed Novo Nordisk shares rose as much as 1.7% to $142.95, while Denmark-listed shares closed marginally higher on Tuesday. Eli Lilly shares were down slightly.
Novo Nordisk, which had a 43% share of the U.S. and Canada insulin market as of November, also said it would reduce the list price of unbranded insulin products to match lowered prices of respective branded insulin products.
Eli Lilly said earlier this month it would cut the list prices for its most commonly prescribed insulin products by 70% in the fourth quarter of this year.
""I think it is a relatively natural consequence of what we have seen their competitor Eli Lilly do. We know there has been political pressure on this issue in general, it is a focus area in the U.S., especially for uninsured patients,"" Jyske Markets analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen said.
Sanofi (SASY.PA) did not specifically comment on Novo Nordisk's announcement but said it would continue to review and update its programs. Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk make up 90% of the U.S. market for insulin.
Stacie Dusetzina, a drug pricing expert and associate professor at Vanderbilt University, said the move was not surprising given the stiff competition for insulin.
The price cuts will also allow Novo to get out of paying substantial rebates to the U.S. government Medicaid program beginning in 2024, which could have been levied under 2021's American Rescue Plan Act if the company had kept prices high.
""They have little to lose by making this change,"" Dusetzina said.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,U.S. FDA approves Acadia's Rett syndrome drug,Reuters,2023-03-14 16:37:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XRR76P24JFOS5KOFHRKLM56YBM.jpg,"March 10 (Reuters) - (This March 10 story has been corrected to remove the word 'genetic' from the headline, and to clarify that the loss of exclusivity year is ""2030"", not ""2028"", in paragraph 7)
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc's (ACAD.O) drug for the treatment of Rett syndrome, a genetic brain disorder, the company said on Friday, making it the first approved drug for the condition.
The U.S. health regulator's decision allows use of the trofinetide, to be sold under the brand name Daybue, in adult and pediatric patients two years of age and older and comes with a warning of diarrhea and weight loss.
The approval comes months after the FDA declined to approve expanded use of Acadia's drug Nuplazid to treat psychosis related to Alzheimer's disease. Analysts have said approval of Daybue would help drive growth for the company in the near term.
View 2 more stories 
""We have put a lot of planning into potential commercialization of trofinetide, including resources for patients to access the drug,"" said Acadia senior executive Kathie Bishop ahead of the approval.
Acadia said it plans to make the drug available to patients by the end of April. It did not disclose details of the price.
Before the approval, David Hoang SMBC Nikko Securities analyst estimated a list price at launch of $450,000 annually. He forecast peak U.S. trofinetide sales of $487.2 million by 2035. RBC Capital Markets analyst Gregory Renza, also writing before the approval, predicted peak U.S. sales to exceed $500 million by 2032 and an average annual launch price of about $425,000.
Acadia forecasts sales of Nuplazid - its only drug on the market - of between $520 and $550 million this year, above analysts' median expectations of $532.8 million, according to Refinitiv data. With the drugmaker facing a loss of exclusivity for Nuplazid in 2030, investors have pinned their hopes on a successful trofinetide launch.
After the FDA declined to approve the expanded use of Nuplazid, Acadia said it would not pursue that indication for Nuplazid further. The drugmaker plans to focus its resources on late-stage development of Nuplazid to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and early-stage development of another candidate, ACP-204, for Alzheimer's-related psychosis.
Rett's syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental condition that occurs primarily in girls. According to government estimates, it affects fewer than 50,000 people in the U.S.
Shares of the California-based company closed 0.68% lower on Friday.
Acadia's drug acts as an artificial form of the insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 and helps reduces inflammation in the nervous tissue as well as aid in the transmission of nerve impulses.
Acadia's application for marketing approval was based on data from a late-stage study in which treatment with the drug showed improvement in core symptoms of the disease compared to a placebo. Improvement of symptoms was measured according to the assessment scales Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire and the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement.
The company had licensed the drug for $10 million up front payment from Australian drugmaker Neuron Pharmaceuticals (NEU.AX) for development and sale in North America in 2018.

Sebastian Guth, president of Bayer's pharmaceuticals business in the Americas, also said in an interview on Wednesday that the company had raised the number of U.S. employees working on marketing for its pharmaceutical business by around 50% over the last three years, and plans to expand on that by another 75% by 2030.
""It's time for us to double down on the U.S.,"" Guth said, noting that Bayer plans to sell the drugs it is developing itself in the country, rather than partner with U.S. companies like it has in the past.
Bayer is looking to build up its portfolio of new drugs as it hopes to improve share prices, which have been hit by concerns over litigation surrounding weedkiller Roundup and a lack of trust in the company's leadership.

It named a new Chief Executive last month, recruiting former Roche executive Bill Anderson to replace embattled CEO Werner Baumann, who had previously said he would hold on until the end of his current term in April 2024.
Guth said he expects peak sales of 12 billion euros from cancer drug Nubeqa, kidney medication Kerendia, and two of its top pipeline assets, experimental stroke drug asundexian and experimental women's health drug elinzanetant. He said he expects more than half of those sales to come from the U.S.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,New York officials ask 3 pharmacy chains for plans on abortion drug access,Reuters,2023-03-10 05:03:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LFZ2VJOS7VINTMCEAQSBVTDIVQ.jpg,"March 9 (Reuters) - New York government officials on Thursday sent a letter to pharmacy operators CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), Walgreens Boot Alliance (WBA.O) and Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), asking about their plans to make abortion pill mifepristone available in the state.
The letter from New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James asked the companies to respond in writing within 10 business days about their commitment to dispense mifepristone at U.S. drug regulator-certified pharmacy locations and via mail in the state.
The letter follows Walgreens' statement last week that it will not dispense abortion pills in some Republican-dominated states.
In a follow-up statement on Monday however, Walgreens said it planned to dispense mifepristone in any jurisdiction where it was legally permissible to do so. When asked about the New York officials' letter, Walgreens directed Reuters to Monday's statement.
Rite Aid and CVS did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Medication abortion, which accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions, has drawn increasing attention since the Supreme Court last year overturned a landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had recognized abortion as a constitutional right nationwide.

New York has taken proactive steps to protect access to in-clinic care, including a $35 million investment to support abortion providers, the state officials said in a statement that accompanied the letter.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said on Monday the state will not do business with Walgreens after the company said it would not dispense abortion pills in some states, following a letter by Republican attorneys general of 20 states, warning it of risking breaking the law if it sold the pills.

The Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) is developing a National Spectrum Strategy with a goal to identify at least 1,500 megahertz of spectrum to study for potential new uses.
""Today spectrum plays a central role in American life in a way that it never did before, from cellphones to aviation safety to weather prediction,"" NTIA Administrator Alan Davidson said in a Reuters interview.
He said the 1,500 megahertz goal over a decade was achievable but difficult.
Reuters first reported the announcement earlier Wednesday.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said NTIA, which jointly manages U.S. spectrum with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), is seeking public input to identify ""new spectrum bands for potential repurposing that will spur competition and innovation for years to come.""
View 2 more stories 
The strategy will address current and future spectrum needs, including fixed and mobile wireless broadband, next-generation satellite communications and other space-based systems; advanced transportation; and industrial and commercial applications.
It will also address wireless medical devices and telemedicine, the Internet of Things and smart cities, and key government uses including national defense, national airspace, critical infrastructure and climate monitoring and forecasting, Davidson said.
Congress last week let the FCC's authority to auction wireless spectrum lapse for the first time in three decades, prompting some lawmakers to quickly restore the authority that has raised more than $200 billion in proceeds for the U.S. government.
FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said the United States needed a ""whole-of-government plan for managing"" spectrum as well as ""short-term action to restore auction authority.""
Demand for spectrum use is soaring as are planned new uses like connected vehicles. Mobile U.S. wireless data traffic rose 20% in 2021.
Davidson said a dispute over 5G C-Band spectrum and aviation use showed industry and government recognize ""we need a coordinated approach"" to managing current and future spectrum use.
""We've got 6G networks coming, new mega-constellations of satellites, connected automobiles, the internet of things - all of that demands new uses of spectrum,"" Davidson said.

The discount store chain said despite a ""modest decrease in customer traffic"" in the reported quarter, it saw an increase in average transaction amount, and reiterated its full-year same-store sales and profit forecasts made in February.
""People have been consolidating their trips and trying to stretch the dollars and maybe make it last longer,"" said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman.
Dollar General, like rival Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O), has seen a slowdown in demand for higher-margin discretionary products such as houseware and apparel in favor of more need-based consumable goods as inflation remains high.

Shares in H&M were down 6% in early trade, underperforming the wider Swedish market (.OMXSPI).
The Swedish group said sales measured in local currencies for the period, its fiscal first quarter, rose 3% from a year earlier.
Jefferies said local-currency sales, the figures most watched by markets, were significantly lighter than consensus estimates and implied that sales in reality fell 3% in February.
The broker called the results ""worse than feared"" and that it expected a loss in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) when the group reports its full first quarter results on March 31.
Credit Suisse also predicted a ""material"" operating loss.

H&M, which is in the middle of a programme to reduce staff and cut other costs, said net sales were up 12% from a year earlier to 54.9 billion crowns ($5.26 billion).
By contrast, market leader Inditex (ITX.MC) reported on Wednesday a 13.5% increase in Feb. 1 - March 13 sales and a 27% net profit increase for its fiscal year through January.
Budget player H&M's profits fell last year as it did not fully pass on soaring raw material, freight and energy costs in an attempt to retain its price-sensitive customers.
Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) said it expected continued input cost increases in the first quarter for the retailer and that it would stay under pressure into the second quarter.
It predicted possible improvements at the end of the second and start of third quarter, citing low prices to appeal to H&M's core customer base, improvements in womenswear, and a new creative director.

Inditex has extended its lead over Swedish rival H&M (HMb.ST), in part thanks to a less price-sensitive customer base. As the cost of making garments increased, H&M took a profit hit while Inditex was able to pass on costs to shoppers.
""Inditex has gained market share because the others have fallen by the wayside,"" said Ann Steele, portfolio manager at Inditex investor Columbia Threadneedle Investments. ""They are executing incredibly well, their margins are amazing.""
But higher expected capital expenditure for 2023, at 1.6 billion euros ($1.69 billion), surprised investors. Inditex shares fell 5%, in line with Europe's STOXX 600 retail sector index (.SXRP), as bank solvency fears hammered European markets.

Maceiras, who took the top job in late 2021, said it had been a year of ""great intensity"" since Marta Ortega replaced her father - Inditex founder Amancio Ortega - as chair of the company.
Inditex's profit jumped by 27% in its financial year to Jan. 31 as sales exceeded pre-pandemic levels. In-store and online sales rose 18% to 32.6 billion euros ($34.99 billion) and were 15% higher than in 2019.
A rapid pace of sales continued in the first six weeks of the 2023 financial year. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, where Inditex stores have been closed since the nations' conflict began, sales between Feb. 1 and March 13 were up 17.5% from the same period a year earlier.
Inditex announced a 29% dividend increase to 1.20 euros per share.
Maceiras defended the company's planned increase to capital expenditure, telling analysts it is ""the right thing"" to keep investing for future growth.
Some of the cash will be spent on further expansion in the United States, with 30 new Zara projects planned from 2023 to 2025, including bigger stores in New York, Chicago, Miami and other cities.
Inditex also said it would invest in automation at its distribution centres in Spain and start phasing out hard anti-theft tags in stores this year. The tags will be replaced with chips sewn into garments, which the company says will cut checkout times by up to 50%.
Inditex has been shutting smaller shops to focus on bigger stores in prime locations with some success. Full-year store sales grew by 23% despite store space decreasing by 6%.
The retailer plans to expand Zara stores on the Rue de Rivoli in Paris and in London's Stratford mall as well as a Bershka store in Milan's Vittorio Emanuele shopping gallery.
China, however, was ""very challenging"" because of COVID-19 restrictions, Maceiras said. Inditex closed stores in mainland China at double its average rate, shutting a fifth of its shops there in 2022.
Inditex executives are due to meet analysts and investors in London on Thursday.

Retail & Consumer,/business/retail-consumer/,"With prices soaring, Dollar Tree ditches eggs until later this year",Jessica DiNapoli,2023-03-14 21:29:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/O2FKTDCG45M4VERRFGIY24QLDI.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) has stopped selling eggs in its Dollar Tree stores, a spokesperson for the U.S. retailer confirmed late Tuesday, as the staple food has skyrocketed in price by as much as 60% during the fall.
The chain, which is increasingly a go-to grocery destination for cash strapped shoppers, has roughly 8,000 Dollar Tree stores across the United States and Canada. Its spokesperson said it does not anticipate being able to bring eggs back into its stores for sale until later this fall.
Egg prices hit record highs of close to an average of $5 a dozen in January, according to economic data, due to a global outbreak of the avian flu. In consumer pricing data released by the government Tuesday, egg prices fell 6.7% in February.
Eggs are big sellers ahead of the spring holidays of Easter and Passover.
Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree has been investing in its refrigerated and frozen food and beverage offerings as shoppers increasingly turn to its stores for bargains due to the shaky economy. But, the retailer has also faced inflation.

The chain announced it would raise prices to $1.25 from $1 in 2021, and in some stores is offering goods like frozen meals for $3 and $5.
Dollar Tree still sells butter in a few markets, the spokesperson said. Butter was also up in price over 20% in February compared to a year ago, according to economic data.
Consumer advocates have criticized Dollar Tree and its main competitor Dollar General Corp (DG.N) for selling junk food and driving grocery stores offering fresher produce out of business.
Dollar Tree also operates 8,200 Family Dollar stores, which sell items up to $10. Those stores still have eggs, the spokesperson said.
Dollar General Corp currently has ""solid in-stock levels"" of eggs at its roughly 19,000 stores, the company said in a statement.

In an interview at the Reuters IMPACT conference, Brodin said some cities were already fully electric for home deliveries, and many were working hard to build the infrastructure needed.
He said there may be challenges in some places.
""In some regions, maybe there will be some challenges where we need to push a bit harder on that, but basically already by 2025, customers should be able to get electrical from IKEA when it comes to deliveries,"" he said.
The move is part of the company's plan to be climate positive - to reduce more greenhouse gas than its entire value chain emits - by 2030.

Brand owner Inter IKEA said in January it was on track to become climate positive by 2030 as its annual carbon emissions fell 6% from pre-pandemic levels despite record sales.
Ingka Group, the owner of most IKEA stores worldwide, already produces more renewable energy than it consumes, having invested around 3 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in wind and solar projects since 2009.
It plans to reach 6.5 billion euros in investments by 2030 as part of efforts to increase the use of renewable energy across its supply chain. It owns 575 wind turbines, 20 solar parks, and 935,000 solar panels on the roofs of IKEA stores and warehouses.
Brodin said companies, particularly in Europe, have had to become more agile as the energy crisis has deepened, and that was likely to speed up society's transition to cleaner energy, but he forecast the next two years would be ""challenging"" for households.
To help with that, IKEA plans to launch a campaign to raise awareness on how households can cut energy use - from LED lighting to solar heat pumps - and to sell low-cost energy-saving products.

Charged,/business/charged/,"In Bolivia's heartland, protests rattle lithium development push",Daniel Ramos,2023-03-16 00:47:00+00:00,,"LA PAZ, March 15 (Reuters) - Protesters in Bolivia's lithium-rich region of Potosi are blockading a key processing plant, demanding legislation that guarantees better benefits for local communities and larger royalties from extraction of the electric battery metal.
The protests are focused on a plant in Llipi, near the Uyuni salt flats, which hold one of the world's largest troves of the metal whose price has surged so much during the global shift towards electric vehicles that it is now called ""white gold"".
Led by the Civic Committee of Potosi (Comcipo), the protesters have threatened the government with an indefinite strike if Potosí does not receive more public works projects and royalties for lithium.
""Unfortunately there are authorities that have tried to generate a kind of division,"" Yamile Cruz, a local protest leader, said in a recorded statement. She said local organizations ""want the development of our department of Potosí, and of our region, because as a region we have given our resources in the past and we are going to continue giving our lithium.""
View 2 more stories 
Potosi, which centuries ago hosted huge silver mines, has long butted heads with the central government over who should benefit from its riches. That is one reason Bolivia has long struggled to develop lithium commercially.
The stand-off could threaten the government's revived push to advance lithium projects and make batteries, including through a recent deal with a Chinese consortium led by the world's largest battery maker CATL.
Local authorities pledged to try to ease the tensions.
""We are going to redouble our efforts as authorities ... so that this mobilization is lifted,"" said Jhonny Mamani, Potosi governor.
Officials blamed the protests on misinformation campaigns and urged Bolivians to allow projects to move ahead or risk losing the chance to develop lithium resources.
""We have a twenty-year window of time to take advantage of this resource and industrialize it in the country,"" Carlos Ramos, head of state lithium company Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos (YLB) told local media.
""The window of time is definite. We have to exploit it now.""

Charged,/business/charged/,"EV startups from Lucid to Rivian see demand fade, supply chain issues linger",Abhirup Roy,2023-03-01 19:06:00+00:00,,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle startups are seeing an unsettling trend, with demand evaporating as potential customers look for deals or hold off on purchases altogether.
Quarterly reports from several companies indicated weakening interest for many of their newer products, a bad sign for companies wrestling with high costs.
Luxury sedan maker Lucid (LCID.O), pickup and SUV maker Rivian (RIVN.O) and electric semi truck maker Nikola (NKLA.O) all flagged economic pressure, with industry experts saying price cuts by industry behemoth Tesla and the availability of cheaper EV models from traditional automakers sapped demand for the startups' new vehicles.
An exception was Fisker (FSR.N), which has barely kicked off production of a $37,499 SUV. That is one of the cheapest prices in the EV group, and Fisker, which has produced only 56 vehicles so far, saw orders improve.
The Model Y from Tesla <TSLA.O> retails for at least $54,990 after recent price cuts, Rivian's R1S SUV is priced around $78,000 and Lucid sells its Air Pure sedans for about $87,400.
View 2 more stories 
Shares of Rivian fell about 13%, while those of Lucid, Nikola and Fisker were down between 2% and 4%. Tesla was trading 1.3% lower.
""EV startups have this sort of double whammy,"" Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at British investment platform AJ Bell told Reuters.
""On the one hand, competition and rate hikes, meaning money ain't so cheap anymore. And on the other hand, inflation, creating a situation where a consumer is thinking hard about the choices that they make now.""
New federal incentives of up to $7,500 for electric cars made in America raised expectations that demand in the sector would jump, although conditions for what counts as U.S.-made have tempered enthusiasm.
Tesla also ignited a price war this year by aggressively slashing vehicle prices, financially secure in its industry-leading profit margins.
By contrast, Lucid reported a slump in reservations to over 28,000 as of Feb. 21 from 34,000 on Nov. 7, adding it would not disclose the number going ahead. Nikola said issues hurting demand for its battery-powered trucks would not ease any time soon.
Rivian forecast 2023 production well below analyst estimates on Tuesday, citing nagging supply chain shortages, sending shares down 8% in after-hours trading.
""Certainly, what we're witnessing in the macro and what we're seeing in terms of interest rate is ... across the industry, having an effective moderating overall demand,"" Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said on a Tuesday conference call.
Rivian did not provide current orders, a number they have updated every quarter.
Lucid and Nikola shares have fallen about 9% and 5% respectively since releasing results, while Fisker has jumped 31% since reporting a rise in orders.
Venture capitalist Cassie Bowe, a partner at Energy Impact Partners, sees demand picking up from next year as the current sentiment forces EV makers to cut prices and introduce lower-priced models this year, and as the supply chain improves.
Bowe oversees investments in a host of startups, including EV charging companies, and said she was looking at investment opportunities in EV makers.
But the four companies have already lost a combined $84 billion in value over the past year, given production woes and supply chain disruptions.
""Across the world, there's a little dose of realism that's coming in saying, maybe the targets that have been set up for EVs aren't realistic and cannot be achieved,"" said Bala Lakshman, a partner at KPMG's automotive strategy advisory.

Silk-FAW signed an agreement in 2021 with local authorities in the northern Emilia-Romagna region to build a production facility and research centre in the city of Reggio Emilia, in an area known as Italy's ""Motor Valley"" - home to brands including Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Ducati.
The facility was part of a wider plan to invest more than a 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) to build electric cars in Italy under the Hongqi brand.
Silk-FAW sent a letter last month to the Emilia-Romagna authorities to inform them of its intention to withdraw from the accord, the document seen by Reuters shows.
The document includes acknowledgement by the Emilia-Romagna region of Silk-FAW's decision.

Silk-FAW did not respond to a request for comment via the company's website. The company does not provide contact details for an official spokesperson.
The business has showcased prototypes and had initially expected to start car production at the beginning of this year, but the company has not yet bought the land to build the site.
Two sources close to the matter said Italian prosecutors were investigating the Silk-FAW project.
Tax police visited the offices of Italian procurement agency Invitalia last week to collect documents on an application by Silk-FAW for 38 million euros in public funding to build the Reggio Emilia plant, the sources said.
Silk-FAW did not respond to a separate request for comment on the matter via the company's website.

Charged,/business/charged/,Volkswagen picks Canada for first battery cell plant outside Europe,Victoria Waldersee,2023-03-14 00:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/JY5JWSMN5JKSBKZZNUMRYCR6N4.jpg,"WOLFSBURG, Germany, March 13 (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) chose Canada to build its first battery cell plant outside Europe, granting its cars access to both Canadian and U.S. subsidies as it works to localise electric vehicle production chain in the region.
Volkswagen AG confirmed in December it was looking for sites for a Canadian plant, six months after signing a memorandum of understanding with the country to secure access to key raw materials for batteries.
Canada, home to a large mining sector for minerals including lithium, nickel and cobalt, is trying to woo companies involved in all levels of the EV supply chain via a multi-billion-dollar green technology fund as the world seeks to cut carbon emissions.
VW joins a Stellantis NV (STLAM.MI) and LG Energy Solutions joint venture in building an EV battery supply chain in Canada, as European car makers seek to benefit from a U.S. climate law that requires 50% of EV battery components be made in North America for vehicles to qualify for tax credits of up to $7,500.
View 2 more stories 
The Canadian federal innovation minister, Francois-Philippe Champagne, called the VW battery plant a ""home run for Canada"" and said it was ""the largest single investment in the auto sector in the history of Canada"", without giving details.
The plant will be based in the city of St. Thomas, around 195 km (120 miles) northeast of Detroit, which sits across the Detroit River across from Windsor, Ontario. The two cities are connected by the Ambassador Bridge.
""I think all the big manufacturers understand that if you need to green the supply chain, Canada is the place to do that,"" said Champagne.
Chemicals giant BASF (BASFn.DE) a year ago also secured land in Canada for a planned battery materials facility to better serve electric vehicle markets in the U.S. and Mexico.
It also reflects efforts by European firms to expand their U.S. presence, eager to tap the generous Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) launched last year by President Joe Biden.
Cars with batteries from the planned Volkswagen site, too, will qualify for IRA subsidies, allocated to vehicles with a battery made with a minimum proportion of critical minerals extracted or processed in the United States or a country with a U.S. free-trade agreement, or recycled in North America.
VW's announcement did not specify the size of the investment or the capacity of the new plant, but board member Thomas Schmall said in August the company was targeting 20 gigawatt hours of capacity at its first North American site.
Volkswagen has long said it is working toward setting up regional supply chains in Europe, North America and China for EV production in light of high transport and logistic costs, supply chain risks and geopolitical tensions.
The IRA gave Volkswagen an incentive to prioritise decisions on North American investments, it said last week, adding that plans for battery plants in Europe were still in place but it would wait to see whether there would be better incentives.

Charged,/business/charged/,"British EV startup Arrival gets $300 mln funding, aims to slow cash-burn",Reuters,2023-03-13 22:28:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7S6NLRXHVBPVRAM75PC64DUHUQ.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - Electric-vehicle (EV) startup Arrival on Monday got a $300 million equity financing line from Westwood Capital and said it seeks to slow its cash-burn rate, as the British firm looks to start U.S. production of its van in late-2024.
U.S.-listed shares of the company closed 13.5% lower.
EV firms have been experiencing a cash crunch over the past few months, as high costs related to production ramp-ups and soaring inflation eat into their reserves.
Arrival expects to achieve its target of quarterly cash-burn rate of $35 million by the second half of 2023, as layoffs and other cost-cut measures take effect. At the end of 2022, the company had about $205 million in cash and cash equivalents.
The developments come after Arrival's warning last year that said it may not have enough cash to keep its business going towards the end of 2023. In January, it named Igor Torgov as its CEO and announced laying off half of its staff.
View 2 more stories 
Arrival also shifted its focus to the United States late last year, in order to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, which provides incentives to spur EV manufacturing and adoption.
High demand for electric vans, meanwhile, has brought legacy automobile players, including General Motors' (GM.N) BrightDrop, Ford Motor Co (F.N), and upstarts like Rivian Automotive (RIVN.O), to the segment.
On Monday, Arrival said the additional capital will provide the company with access to more liquidity and that the infusion will fund the business into late-2023.
The capital raised, however, will not provide for investments in production of its van in its Charlotte, North Carolina facility and the company said it was kicking off fundraising efforts to fund the U.S. production plan.
The company also called for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders to vote on a reverse stock split proposal to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing rules.

Charged,/business/charged/,Volkswagen: no rush to decide on new European battery plants,Victoria Waldersee,2023-03-13 16:22:00+00:00,,"WOLFSBURG, March 13 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) battery needs are covered until 2028 by its three confirmed factories in Europe - the Salzgitter plant in Germany, Northvolt's plant in Sweden and a planned plant in Valencia, board member Thomas Schmall said on Monday.
The carmaker is still targeting 240 gigawatt hours of battery cell production capacity in Europe but could do this with fewer than the originally planned six plants, Schmall said.
""We stick to the 240 gigawatt hours. Whether we need five or six plants depends on the incentive strategy of the countries... this is not decided yet,"" he added.
The executive said he expects demand for between 60 and 100 gigawatt hours of capacity in North America, but did not give details on how much of this capacity will be provided by Volkswagen-owned plants.
It was a misunderstanding that announcements of new plants in North America meant that the carmaker would do less in Europe, Schmall said, adding it was simply waiting to see what Europe had to offer as a response to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The Valencia plant, confirmed last year, is due to begin production in 2026. Volkswagen does not need to start construction of a new plant in Europe until 2025, Schmall said, adding a decision on the next location could be made sooner if a similar tailwind to the IRA materialised in Europe.
The carmaker was standardising the structure of its factories and batteries, but the chemistry of the battery would differ for different models, Schmall said: Batteries for entry-level models will use iron phosphate, while medium-level models will have high manganese content and top models increased silicon content.
With its PowerCo battery unit, Volkswagen wanted to become a significant player but not the only player in the battery space, Schmall added, highlighting that 95% of the battery market is dominated by Asian players.

Charged,/business/charged/,Xi adds oversight risk to China EV battery growth plans,Reuters,2023-03-13 03:14:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/JQ7T2XV4CFJATNUDVJNXVLPC4M.jpg,"SHANGHAI, March 10 (Reuters) - The world's largest battery maker CATL and its rivals in China were put on notice this week with a message from the top.
When Chinese President Xi Jinping said he was “both pleased and concerned” about CATL’s (300750.SZ) electric vehicle (EV) battery dominance, industry executives and regulators heard a caution to be ready to throttle back expansion to keep the current boom from collapsing in a bust of overcapacity.
Xi’s remarks, made in response to a presentation by CATL's chairman Robin Zeng on the sidelines of China's annual parliament on Monday, showed CATL has drawn the attention of top Chinese officials. Since last year, CATL's customers have complained about its market position and the company itself has warned about the risks of the industry expanding too quickly.
Three battery industry executives - including two at CATL - and two people close to regulators working with the industry told Reuters they understood Xi’s remarks as a warning to both the company and the wider battery industry.
View 2 more stories 
One of the five, a senior manager at CATL, who like others asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said Xi's remarks were concerning for the whole industry.
""Pressure is being imposed on all parties,"" he said, adding that ""even if the government steps on the brake, CATL's position within the industry won't be shaken"".
Xi was quoted by Xinhua as saying regulation had a place to ensure that emerging industries like battery production developed in a “steady and prudent manner” to avoid “a boom and a headlong rush that would dissipate in the end"".
CATL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Government scrutiny of CATL and its smaller rivals, which represent 60% of global battery supply, would mark a speedbump for an industry that has been more accustomed to benefitting from subsidies.
Ningde, Fujian-based CATL, which is expanding in Germany and the United States, controls 37% of the global battery market alone, more than the next three suppliers combined. Its cell-to-pack technology has provided automakers like Tesla with less-expensive iron phosphate lithium-ion batteries.
Consultant Rystad Energy estimates that battery production capacity in China will reach 1,338 gigawatt hours (GWh) by year end, up 23%. CATL alone has 542 GWh of capacity online or under construction, enough to power the equivalent of more than 7 million Model Ys.
But EV sales in China have started to slow, prompting CATL to offer discounts to smaller EV makers in China in February in exchange for locking in future orders.
Zeng told investors in May that the recent wave of investment worth billions of dollars in battery production could leave excess capacity as technology evolves. The company, citing supply deals with BMW (BMWG.DE), Daimler, VW (VOWG_p.DE), Ford (F.N) and Hyundai (005380.KS), told analysts and investors this week that it had been cautious.
""We will adjust capacity construction according to timely evaluations of the market demand,"" the company's executives told analysts after it released its annual earnings on Thursday.
Xi has in recent months voiced support for private businesses to drive growth, but executives in a range of sectors have been watching how and whether those comments will translate into action after a two-year crackdown on industries from education to technology.
While there has been no indication CATL is being targeted by regulators, it has faced pushback from Chinese automakers who have complained about its pricing power in the world's largest EV market.
In July, at a session attended by hundreds, including industry and local government officials and CATL’s Zeng, the chairman of state-owned Guangzhou Automobile Group (601238.SS) Zeng Qinghong shocked the crowd by taking a shot at CATL's pricing.
""With batteries now taking up 60% of the cost of each vehicle, how am I not actually working for CATL?"" he asked.
Others, such as Xpeng (9868.HK) and Nio (9866.HK), are finding alternatives to CATL. Privately, some auto executives, who ask not to be named because of ongoing ties to CATL, have echoed the criticism made by GAC's Zeng.
CATL’s deal to license its battery technology for production at a plant run by Ford Motor Co also faces potential scrutiny and pushback in the United States and China as EV industry competition between the two nations intensifies. Republican Senator Marco Rubio has called for the Biden administration to review the deal.
CATL told investors that the partnership, which it said was based on ""commercial considerations"" has been moving ahead.

Charged,/business/charged/,Ford set to resume F-150 Lightning production next week,David Shepardson,2023-03-10 23:41:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YECC2WB6K5JCBNCO5Y5KIJCWLQ.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Friday it was on track to resume production of F-150 Lightning vehicles on Monday after the No. 2 U.S. automaker recalled 18 electric trucks due to a battery cell manufacturing defect.
The recall announced Friday stemmed from production over a four-week period starting at the end of last year. Ford said it had recently established ""that 18 vehicles containing cells from that four-week period had made it to dealers and customers.""
Ford said it will replace the battery packs in the 18 vehicles but said it is not aware of any fires or any injuries related to the recall.
The automaker previously announced it planned to restart production Monday after it halted output after a EV battery fire in early February.
Ford said an EV truck caught fire Feb. 4 during a pre-delivery quality inspection in a company holding lot in Dearborn, Michigan and spread to two other trucks. The automaker halted production the next day.

The automaker said Friday ""the root cause identified was related to battery cell production at the SK On plant in Georgia. SK On is the automotive battery unit of SK Innovation ((096770.KS).
Ford said together with SK On it had ""confirmed the root causes and have implemented quality actions.""
Ford said Friday it still has not set a date for resuming deliveries but said production is on track to resume Monday with a ""clean stock of battery packs.""

The plan will involve an overall investment worth over 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) in Italy, including public funds, ACC said in a statement after meeting unions in Rome.
Carmaker Stellantis has plans to develop three 'gigafactories' in Europe to serve its increased production of battery electric vehicles. They will be built in France, Germany and Italy, through ACC, with a capacity of 40 gigawatt hours (GWh) each by 2030.
The Italian project will be set up in the southern city of Termoli, through the conversion of an existing Stellantis engine and gearbox plant, currently employing around 2,000 workers.
It should start operations at the beginning of 2026, while it should reach full capacity in 2030 with at least 1,800 employees, ACC said in the statement.

Sylvain Filippi, managing director of Envision Racing, said it would soon become more expensive to manufacture traditional cars than their electric counterparts, given the cost of manufacturing internal combustion vehicles is increasing.
""In 2025/2026 ... you'll start to see parity on the supply side, in developed countries,"" Filippi said during an interview at the Reuters IMPACT climate conference on Tuesday, adding sticker price parity meant the total cost of ownership would be lower.
""That's the tipping point. When that happens and we can manufacture these cars at scale, then the floodgates will open,"" Filippi said.
""At that stage, buying an internal combustion car will be a very bad idea because the original value of these cars will be nothing. It will became a really bad asset and I think the transition will accelerate really rapidly.""

Electric vehicle (EV) sales could reach 33% globally by 2028 and 54% by 2035, as demand accelerates in most major markets, according to a study released earlier this year by consultant AlixPartners.
EVs accounted for less than 8% of global sales last year, and just under 10% in the first quarter of 2022.
To support that demand, automakers and suppliers now expect to invest at least $526 billion on EVs and batteries from 2022-2026, according to AlixPartners, more than double the five-year EV investment forecast of $234 billion from 2020-2024.

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,U.S. issues initial Medicare drug price negotiation guidance,Ahmed Aboulenein,2023-03-15 22:20:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/6U6M35HO7ZM3FHV3R5IJRBINMQ.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. government will select the Medicare program's 10 costliest prescription medicines based on gross spending for negotiating price cuts that will go into effect in 2026, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) said on Wednesday
CMS will only accept one formal written counter offer during the negotiation process, but will allow up to three additional in-person or virtual negotiation meetings, the agency said in initial guidance issued on Wednesday for its Medicare drug price negotiation program.
The program was established under the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Joe Biden signed into law last year. It will for the first time allow Medicare, the government health insurance program for millions of Americans age 65 and older, to negotiate prices on prescription drugs, beginning with the ones on which it spends the most.
""Through the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, we will make sure seniors get a fair price on Medicare’s costliest prescription drugs, promote competition in the market, and ensure Medicare is strong for beneficiaries today and into the future,"" Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra said in a statement.

CMS will announce the first 10 drugs on Sept. 1. The negotiation period will start in February and last until August. In September of 2024, CMS expects to publish the negotiated ""maximum fair price"" that would become effective in 2026.
For the purposes of selecting drugs for negotiation, CMS said it would include spending on all formulations or dosage forms of a drug, even if it received a separate U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a different use.
The agency said it was soliciting public comment on parts of the guidance and would consider any it receives by April 14, but the selection process for which drugs will be subject to negotiation is final.
CMS said it will use the price of therapeutic alternatives to a drug, if any exist, as a starting point in developing its initial price offer, taking into account the medicine's clinical benefit, including how it compares to competitors.
Big-selling drugs made by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY.N), Pfizer (PFE.N), and AbbVie (ABBV.N) are likely to be among the medicines subject to the first round of price negotiations, according to analyses by academics and Wall Street analysts shared with Reuters.
CMS also announced a list of 27 drugs earlier on Wednesday that would be subject to penalties because their manufacturers hiked prices last quarter higher than the rate of inflation, a move it said would reduce out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients by as much as $390 per dose.

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,"With positive combo meningococcal vaccine data, GSK eyes US approval",Reuters,2023-03-14 12:47:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/RKCPMZ7S5JMZHA7LO754L4AON4.jpg,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - GSK (GSK.L) on Tuesday said that late-stage data showed its experimental combination meningococcal vaccine was as effective as two of its existing vaccines that target different strains of the bacteria behind the sometimes life-threatening infections.
If approved, the combo vaccine could simplify the immunisation schedule in the United States and likely expand GSK's already dominant market share there for vaccines used to prevent illnesses caused by meningococcal bacteria. The bacterial infection can lead to severe, and sometimes deadly, bloodstream infections as well as severe swelling in the brain and spinal cord.
The trial, which involved about 3,650 participants aged 10 to 25, evaluated the immune responses from two doses of the combo vaccine, called MenABCWY, given six months apart. These responses were compared to participants who received GSK's approved vaccines, Bexsero and Menveo.
In the United States, a four-shot regimen of Bexsero and Menveo is needed to protect against the five most common strains of meningococcal bacteria. The high number of doses, plus low awareness of the disease, are factors behind low immunisation rates, GSK said in its press release announcing the data.
View 2 more stories 
There is no combination vaccine on the market - a gap GSK intends to fill with the new combination. The company hopes to file for U.S. approval later this year.
""In the US, routine use of a 5-in-1 meningococcal vaccine with a two-dose regimen in adolescents at 16 to 18 years of age, just before this disease’s incidence peak, could drive significant public health impact,"" said Tony Wood, GSK's chief scientific officer, in a statement on Tuesday.
Last year, GSK's meningitis vaccines generated around 1.1 billion pounds in combined sales across the dozens of countries they are already approved in.
The MenABCWY positive readout comes as the British drugmaker's vaccine portfolio is expected to get a big boost from the expected launch of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in the U.S. later this year.
The blockbuster potential of the RSV vaccine has generated considerable investor enthusiasm, even amid concerns that the drugmaker could struggle to sustain growth through the end of this decade given key patent expiries and forecast declining revenues for some of its current bestsellers.
GSK has the world's largest vaccine R&D department and has a broad portfolio of shots, including its blockbuster shingles vaccine Shingrix. Its vaccines business brought in 7.9 billion pounds ($9.61 billion)in sales last year.

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,"Bristol Myers, Pfizer, AbbVie drugs likely to face U.S. price negotiation",Michael Erman,2023-03-13 15:48:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The blood thinner Eliquis from Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer's breast cancer drug Ibrance and AbbVie's leukemia treatment Imbruvica are likely to be among 10 big-selling medicines subject to U.S. price negotiations for 2026, according to five Wall Street and academic analyses shared with Reuters.
Last year Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), giving the U.S. government power to start the first price negotiations over prescription drugs for its Medicare health program covering more than 60 million Americans, most over age 65.
The government will launch the negotiation process in September by naming the first drugs it plans to target. They are expected to be the 10 pharmacy-based prescription drugs it spends the most on for the year ended May 2023.
For months, lobbyists for the biggest pharmaceutical companies have been meeting with Medicare officials trying to game out which drugs the government will choose, what discounts they will seek, and ways to redress the final price.
View 2 more stories 
Five lobbyists told Reuters they have been given little information beyond what has been publicly disclosed.
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which will run the negotiation process, said in a statement it expects to answer some of the industry’s questions in a guidance document it will circulate this spring. A spokesperson said the agency intends to use feedback from monthly calls with drugmakers to inform implementation.
For individual companies, the financial impact is expected to vary. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that negotiations will save the government around $4.8 billion in 2026 and nearly $25 billion a year by 2031, as more drugs are added to the negotiation process.
Those savings will help fund the bill's out of pocket spending caps and reduced cost sharing for older Americans.
""We couldn't have the other parts of the IRA without this Medicare negotiation,"" said Sean Dickson, director of the West Health Policy Center, a non-partisan healthcare think tank.
Reuters compiled five lists prepared by Wall Street analysts and academics with a total of 27 drugs across them.
Eliquis, which Bristol Myers (BMY.N) shares with Pfizer (PFE.N), Ibrance, and Imbruvica, sold by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), appear on every list.
Novo Nordisk's (NOVOb.CO) diabetes drug Ozempic, prostate cancer treatment Xtandi from Astellas Pharma (4503.T) and Pfizer, and J&J's (JNJ.N) blood thinner Xarelto are on three of the lists.
The lists differ because each analyst has their own projections for drug sales, and it is not certain if the government will consider gross sales or net sales after market discounts.
Bristol Myers Chief Commercialization Officer Chris Boerner said in an interview last month that Eliquis may well be in the government's crosshairs. ""We would anticipate that you could potentially see price setting by the government with Eliquis,” he said.
Astellas said it was analyzing information from CMS to understand its potential impact. Pfizer, Novo Nordisk and J&J declined to comment on the likelihood their drugs would be included in the first round of negotiations. AbbVie did not respond to request for comment.
Medicare is the biggest single purchaser of drugs in the country, reimbursing private companies and hospitals for medications used by individuals covered by the program.
Under the new law’s process, the government will publish its list of the first 10 drugs for negotiation from the pharmacy-based prescription drug program called Part D on Sept. 1.
Drugmakers will have to submit data making the case for each treatment's value by Oct. 2, including whether the drug represents a therapeutic advance and if it serves unmet medical needs.
Drugmakers have long presented similar value-based arguments in negotiations with private buyers and European governments.
Three industry lobbyists told Reuters they are pressing Medicare officials to commit to a process under which it will reveal how the government arrived at a final price, and have asked for a framework for resolving disputes.
Without such a process, drugmakers could resort to lawsuits as a last-ditch attempt to stop government price setting - even though the IRA exempts the process from lawsuits, two of those lobbyists said.
One of those lobbyists suggested adoption of an appeal process similar to ones used by European countries, where price-setting regimes have long existed, would give companies recourse outside of lawsuits.
A Medicare spokesperson declined to say if the agency was considering such a move.
Steven Pearson, president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), an influential research group that does drug pricing value assessments, said how the government comes to a price based on data companies submit should be clearly communicated.
""It's going to be frustrating to a lot of people,"" he said, ""if, at the end of the day, we don't really understand how this information is being interpreted and applied to a final decision.""

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,US FDA approves Pfizer's nasal spray for migraine,Khushi Mandowara,2023-03-10 20:07:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PTZLI6A6NZPDXDPADM2FPCZ6EA.jpg,"March 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) nasal spray for migraine, giving patients access to a potentially fast-acting pain-relief option for headaches.
The drug, Zavzpret, was approved for the treatment of acute migraine, the company said. Pfizer gained the drug as well as FDA-approved oral migraine pill Nurtec ODT, through its $11.6 billion buyout of Biohaven Pharmaceutical last year.
Pfizer has forecast peak sales from its migraine pipeline to be around $6 billion.
Zavzpret, to be launched in July, would be comparable in price to other FDA-approved migraine medicines that belong to the same class of drugs, Pfizer told Reuters.
The drug, also known as zavegepant, will be competing with rivals from AbbVie Inc , Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N), Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA.TA) that are also calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors.

""The (Pfizer) drug has two main advantages over the older CGRP antagonists: it is safe for people with cardiovascular risk factors, and second, it does not cause medication overuse headache,"" said Dr Emad Estemalik, psychiatrist at Cleveland Clinic.
A nasal spray would also benefit patients who are unable to swallow a pill, Estemalik said.
Pfizer is hoping to gain a competitive edge in the migraine drug category with Zavzpret, which Biohaven has called the ""Epipen of migraine"", for its quick action.
Zavzpret's approval was based on late-stage study data that showed the drug was superior in 13 of 17 goals when compared to placebo, including pain relief in 15 minutes and normal function at 30 minutes.
About 39 million people in the United States suffer from migraine, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.
Pfizer's shares were marginally up at $39.75 in noon trading.

Breast density can influence the accuracy of mammography, which relies on X-rays passing through breast tissues to diagnose and locate tumors.
Mammograms remain the best tool for screening and detection of breast cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer among women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The agency recommends patients with dense breasts, a normal and common finding in mammograms, to discuss their individual situation with their respective healthcare providers.
The updated rules will help ensure patients receive information on the potential need for further evaluation or a repeat mammogram, the health regulator said.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,"Analysis: Australia's DIY pension funds lose millions on crypto bets, investors not sweating it",Lewis Jackson,2023-03-02 06:08:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PZT3EU2W5VLNZBMWBMR5IM6PAI.jpg,"SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Thousands of Australians who used do-it-yourself (DIY) pension funds to bet on cryptocurrencies face hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, jeopardising their savings in a scheme originally set up to ensure adequate retirement income.
These risky bets are possible as DIY or self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs) fall outside the remit of the prudential regulator that oversees professionally managed funds, thereby allowing them to invest with fewer restrictions.
DIY pension funds account for a fourth of Australia's A$3.4 trillion ($2.29 trillion) pension pool. Tens of thousands set up such funds over the pandemic, pouring money set aside for retirement into markets, including cryptocurrency. But regulators can do little more than warn about the risks.
Peter, 50, who describes himself as a ""bitcoiner"", is among those who is content to ignore the warnings.
He moved his A$130,000 nest egg from an Australian pension fund into an SMSF and invested it in bitcoin in 2021. At one point his fund was up A$100,000 as bitcoin scaled an all-time high, but is now ""underwater"" after prices crashed.
View 2 more stories 
However, Peter continues to buy bitcoin.
""My conviction hasn't changed,"" said Peter, without giving his full name to keep his financial affairs private.
""It doesn't bother me, honestly. After ten years of being on this ride, part of me has died inside when it comes to price.""
And Peter is not alone.
According to Australia's tax office, more funds are adding cryptocurrencies, although they remain a small minority.
There is about A$880 billion in Australia's SMSFs, with crypto assets accounting for $1.4 billion of that in fiscal 2021. The quantity of crypto assets has likely grown since then.
Regulatory rules require investors to keep assets for retirement, run audits and acknowledge risks, but say nothing about the appropriateness of investments by SMSFs.
That is in stark contrast to measures in some other countries or even Australia's oversight of the A$2.3 trillion professionally managed pension sector where funds can be barred from taking new members if they underperform.
The tax office does not provide information about portfolio losses. However, bitcoin prices, near $24,000 now, are 16% below the 2021 trough and 60% below the 2021 peak.
Assuming an average 40% decline would imply an almost A$600 million drop in the value of SMSF cryptocurrency investments, Reuters calculations show.
This estimate was validated by Liam Shorte, a financial planner specialising in SMSFs.
""Most of the people I'm dealing with got in late,"" he says.
But crypto loyalists believe the asset class should be judged over decades, not days.
""If I want an early retirement, this will help,"" said Ken, a 47-year old professional who piled into cryptocurrency in May 2021 after first checking with his wife.
He bought more than A$100,000 of bitcoin and ether via his SMSF, accounting for 10-20% of the fund.
""If the investment goes pear-shaped, I work an extra year,"" said Ken, who also did not want his full name disclosed.
New SMSFs grew 30% in 2021, a survey from Vanguard and Investment Trends shows, with more than half the new starters surveyed saying they could outperform their pension fund.
""I was getting calls every week at the peak,"" says Sevan Tuna, managing director at financial adviser Alexander Spencer. ""It was ridiculous, people had a lot of time on their hands.""
Australia's DIY pension sector combines size and freedom in a way that sets it apart from other countries.
The United States also has a freewheeling DIY pension sector but take-up is negligible.
In Britain, self-managed pension funds cannot directly invest in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, according to Victoria Scholar, head of investment for Interactive Investor.
Hargreaves Landsdown, among Britain's largest retail stockbrokers, also bars its 460,000 self-managed pension customers from property.
But in Australia, SMSFs can take out loans for houses and farms, buy shares in private companies or collectibles like fine wine and jewellery.
Australian regulators in 2019 recommended banning SMSFs from borrowing, and in the same year the Australian Tax Office (ATO) warned 17,700 fund trustees they were not diversified enough.
Where funds are highly concentrated, investors must show they have considered the risks, the ATO said in a statement.
Treasury, which oversees the ATO, said there are no changes planned to SMSF governance.
Regulating SMSF investment decisions could have unpopular consequences, Tuna said. Forced diversification could limit big property investments. Property and the loans to finance it make up a fifth of all SMSF assets.
John Maroney, who stepped down as head of Australia's SMSF association this week, said big cryptocurrency investments are concerning but changing rules would add costs.
""Our general position is if it's legal to invest in speculative assets, then no further restrictions should apply to SMSF investments.""

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Crypto exchange Binance to halt sterling transfers,Elizabeth Howcroft,2023-03-14 11:32:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MHZVZYEMHFKKXI3OFVHYEGCPE4.jpg,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Binance is halting its sterling deposits and withdrawals, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday, a month after the world's largest crypto exchange ceased dollar transfers.
Binance has been informed by its partner for sterling transfers, Paysafe, that it would halt its services from May 22, the spokesperson said, impacting all Binance customers.
Sterling transfers for new users were stopped on Monday, it said.
""Binance will ensure that affected users are still able to access their GBP balances,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the change ""affects less than 1% of Binance users.""
Binance, which has more than 128 million customers, did not give details on the number of clients the move would impact. The company is working to find an ""alternative solution"" for sterling transfers, the spokesperson said.
The cessation of sterling transfers, first reported by crypto news outlet The Block, is the latest obstacle for Binance in accessing traditional currencies. Binance last month suspended all dollar bank transfers amid a growing crackdown on crypto by U.S. authorities.

The Justice Department is also investigating Binance, run by billionaire CEO Changpeng Zhao, for suspected money laundering and sanctions violations, Reuters has previously reported. A top Binance executive told The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg last month that Binance expected to pay penalties to resolve U.S. investigations into the company.
A further hindrance for Binance in accessing dollars came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission told the company which issued its ""BUSD"" stablecoin it was considering taking action against it. The move sparked around $6 billion in outflows as of earlier this month.
The importance of sterling funding to Binance is unclear. The company does not make public its finances, with the core of the business – the giant Binance.com exchange - mostly hidden from public view.
Paysafe did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The company offers the service via UK payments network Faster Payments, which also had no immediate comment.
A spokesperson for Skrill, the Paysafe unit that works with Binance, told crypto website Decrypt that ""the UK regulatory environment in relation to crypto is too challenging to offer this service at this time and so this is a prudent decision on our part taken in an abundance of caution.""
Britain's financial watchdog said last year that it lacked powers to stop Binance from accessing the Faster Payments network via Paysafe.
The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned consumers in June 2021 that Binance did not hold ""any form"" of permission to offer services regulated by Britain.
The FCA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,U.S. crypto firms seek Swiss banking partners amid banking meltdown,Elizabeth Howcroft,2023-03-13 17:52:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VEMNAX3DIBMGZGCA5HIDFVEFVM.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S.-based crypto firms are trying to open Swiss bank accounts after the collapse of two U.S. crypto-focused banks made it harder for them to use lenders in the United States, but bankers said the Swiss firms may not take them.
Crypto-focused U.S. bank Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) said it planned to close last week after it was hit with losses following the dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November last year.
Its closure was followed by the collapse on Sunday of Signature Bank (SBNY.O) -- seen as U.S. crypto firms' main alternative to Silvergate -- in one of the largest failures in U.S. banking history.
The global banking sector was thrown into turmoil by Friday's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which sent global bank stocks plunging on Monday on concern about further contagion. The tech-focused lender also banked crypto companies and was the second-biggest U.S. bank failure.

Crypto analysts said that the U.S. bank closures, along with a regulatory crackdown in the U.S., would push firms to seek banking partnerships in Europe, Asia, and ""offshore"".
""U.S. regulators have issued multiple warnings to banks about potential risks of working with crypto companies. They haven’t banned it explicitly but made it clear this would be frowned upon,"" said Ivan Kachkovski, crypto and FX analyst at UBS.
""This is likely to push crypto companies to other jurisdictions in search of non-U.S. banks willing to work with the industry.""
Switzerland, long famous for its private banking sector, has also been one of the more welcoming countries in Europe for crypto firms, with the Swiss city of Zug dubbed ""The Crypto Valley.""
Yves Longchamp, managing director of crypto-focused SEBA Bank in Switzerland said there had been a ""pronounced uptick"" in traffic to the bank's website from the U.S., and that in a global call on Friday representatives from the Singapore, Hong Kong, Abu Dhabi, and Switzerland offices all said they'd seen increased interest from prospective clients.
""Crypto firms and other money managers have already started the onboarding process and many calls are scheduled next weeks,"" he said via email.
Switzerland-based Arab Bank said it saw an increase in U.S. firms, mostly crypto funds or involved in crypto venture capital, seeking to open accounts in the last few weeks as doubts about Silvergate grew. Rani Jabban, head of treasury and financial institutions at Arab Bank, said around 80% of them had been Silvergate customers.
""We had 10-20 enquiries so far… but that doesn't mean that we can cater and open accounts for all of them,"" he said, citing regulatory difficulties of onboarding U.S.-based clients and estimating that only one or two of them would ultimately become Arab Bank customers.
Crypto firms relied on Silvergate's crypto payments network, the Silvergate Exchange Network, which allowed round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.
""I don't see any banks also offering the structure that Signature and Silvergate were offering with their internal blockchain 24/7 settlement,"" Arab Bank's Rani said.
Swiss bank Sygnum, which describes itself on its website as ""the world's first digital asset bank"", is sticking to its policy not to take on U.S. clients ""due to a lack of regulatory clarity"" Sygnum's chief marketing officer Dominic Castley told Reuters via email.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Major crypto coins stabilise after U.S. intervenes on SVB collapse,Tom Wilson,2023-03-13 14:48:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PRFYGOIDWZJY7DHXNCFFS7ZCNU.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Major cryptocurrencies stabilised on Monday after U.S. authorities announced plans to limit the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the issuer of the USD Coin stablecoin said it remained redeemable with the dollar.
U.S. authorities launched emergency measures on Sunday to shore up confidence in the banking system after the failure of SVB (SIVB.O) threatened to trigger a broader financial, and said SVB customers would have access to their deposits from Monday.
USD Coin, also known as USDC , recovered to $0.998, up from a record low of $0.87 hit on Saturday, far below its intended peg of 1:1 against the dollar. The fall was sparked by concerns on the exposure of Circle — the U.S. firm that issues USDC — to SVB.
Top cryptocurrency bitcoin , meanwhile, gained 6% to $23,350, a recovery of over 13% from its lows hit a day earlier.
Jeremy Allaire, CEO of USDC issuer Circle, said in a tweet on Sunday that the company's $3.3 billion USDC reserves deposit - about 8% of its total - held at SVB would be fully available when U.S. banks open on Monday.

""Circle's USDC operations will open for business, including with new automated settlement via our new partnership with Cross River Bank,"" Allaire said.
New Jersey-based Cross River did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Stablecoins such as USDC, the second-largest by market size, are a crucial cog in the world of crypto trading. They are designed to keep a steady value, and are typically backed by reserves of traditional assets such as dollars, bonds or gold.
Stocks exposed to crypto also rallied.
Crypto miners Riot Blockchain (RIOT.O) and Marathon Digital (MARA.O) both gained over 11%, while U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN.O) added 6.3%.
Analysts, warned that market sentiment would remain skittish despite the U.S. measures.
""Markets remain unsettled from the SVB failure,"" said Alvin Tan, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Singapore. ""The situation is evolving, but volatility looks set to remain elevated in coming days.""
The relief for crypto was tempered by New York's chief financial regulator taking possession of Signature Bank (SBNY.O), a key banking firm for crypto companies.
With the fall of SVB and California-based Silvergate Bank, its closure means that three of the main U.S. banks used by crypto businesses have failed this year.
Shares of Signature Bank were halted for trading, with U.S. officials saying depositors of Signature Bank would be made whole at no loss to the taxpayer.
Its fall represents another blow to connections between the crypto and banking sectors, already strained by a growing U.S. regulatory crackdown.
Top U.S. exchange Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O)tweeted on Sunday that after Signature's fall it was ""facilitating all client cash transactions with other banking partners."" According to Coinbase's website, these are JPMorgan Chase, Cross River Bank and South Dakota-based Pathward.
Coinbase said that as of Friday's close, it had an approximately $240 million balance in corporate cash at Signature, but expects to fully recover the funds.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,US government appeals approval of Voyager sale to Binance.US,Dietrich Knauth,2023-03-10 19:28:00+00:00,,"March 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department Justice has appealed a court order approving Voyager Digital's bankruptcy plan, creating a new hurdle for the crypto lender's plan to sell its assets and transfer its customers to Binance.US in a deal valued at $1.3 billion.
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Office of the U.S. Trustee, the Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog, filed a notice of appeal late Thursday in U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan. It did not detail why they were appealing.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles, who is overseeing Voyager's Chapter 11 bankruptcy process, had approved Voyager's restructuring plan, which is built around the acquisition by crypto exchange Binance.US, at a hearing on Tuesday after overruling objections from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and DOJ.
Voyager, Binance.US and the DOJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the appeal.
View 2 more stories 
Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee and U.S. Attorney's office spoke up at hearings to consider Voyager's bankruptcy plan to oppose provisions Voyager included to protect employees from potential legal claims resulting from actions taken during the bankruptcy. They argued that Wiles' order approving the plan was written too broadly, potentially preventing the government from bringing regulatory enforcement actions or criminal charges if misconduct was discovered later.
Wiles disagreed, saying that Voyager and its employees should not be penalized for carrying out a court-approved sale to Binance.US. If the DOJ or any government agency had evidence of misconduct specifically related to the bankruptcy, they should have presented it in court, Wiles said.
In approving the plan, Wiles had also overruled an objection from the SEC, saying that it attempted to cast doubt on the legality of the sale without presenting any evidence that Voyager or Binance.US had violated securities laws.
Binance.US has agreed to pay $20 million in cash to Voyager, and to take on crypto assets deposited by Voyager customers. The Those assets, valued at $1.3 billion in February, account for the bulk of the deal's valuation, according to Voyager.
Last week, Voyager said it still could pull out of the Binance.US deal and make an effort to return customer funds without outside help.
Voyager filed for bankruptcy in July, months after the crash of major crypto tokens TerraUSD and Luna sent shockwaves across the digital asset industry.

New York Attorney General Letitia James on Thursday referred to Ether as a security in her lawsuit against KuCoin for failing to register with the state before facilitating cryptocurrency transactions on its platform. KuCoin is one of the biggest cryptocurrency platforms in the United States.
""The situation in Ethereum (the blockchain that underpins Ether) could get real ugly,"" investment research firm Citron Research tweeted.
The world's second-biggest cryptocurrency token was trading around $1,390, its lowest since January 10.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Judge still thinks proposed Bankman-Fried bail conditions too lenient,Luc Cohen,2023-03-10 17:30:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FC4XV45UMJK6FNSN2USMACZIT4.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday said he remained unsatisfied with a proposal to impose tight restrictions on how the indicted FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried communicates with the outside world while free on bail.
Bankman-Fried is fighting to stay out of jail pending his scheduled Oct. 2 fraud trial, with U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan expressing concern the former billionaire was testing the limits of his $250 million bail package.
Prosecutors have charged Bankman-Fried, 31, with stealing billions of dollars in FTX customer funds to plug losses at his hedge fund Alameda Research, and making tens of millions of dollars in illegal political donations to buy influence in Washington, D.C.
Bankman-Fried's behavior while on bail became an issue after prosecutors said he tried to contact FTX Chief Executive John Ray and an in-house lawyer, in a possible attempt to tamper with witnesses. Defense lawyers said Bankman-Fried was trying to help, not interfere.
View 2 more stories 
Last Friday, prosecutors and defense lawyers proposed letting Bankman-Fried have a flip phone with no internet capability and a basic laptop with limited functions, but be forbidden from using other electronic communication devices.
But at Friday's hearing, Kaplan said Bankman-Fried was ""inventive,"" and could find a way to circumvent the restrictions and secretly communicate with others electronically.
""He could find a way around it and conceivably not get caught,"" Kaplan said.
Christian Everdell, a lawyer for Bankman-Fried, said he would work with prosecutors on a new proposal to address the judge's concerns.
Late last month, prosecutors added new fraud and conspiracy charges against Bankman-Fried over the November collapse of his now-bankrupt exchange, meaning he now faces 12 charges.
He had pleaded not guilty to the original eight charges in January.
Three of his former closest associates have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors: former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, former FTX technology chief Gary Wang and former FTX engineering chief Nishad Singh.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Instant View: Silvergate's planned liquidation fuels another crypto rout,Reuters,2023-03-10 05:31:00+00:00,,"March 9 (Reuters) - Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N), one of the biggest banks in the cryptocurrency industry, said on Wednesday it was planning to wind down operations and liquidate voluntarily.
MARKET REACTION:
Shares of crypto-related companies fell on Thursday, as the bank's collapse sparked a crisis of confidence in the industry.
Silvergate shares were down 26% while peer Signature Bank (SBNY.O) and former Silvergate partner Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) fell 8% each.
COMMENTS:
""Investors are concerned about the consequences of Silvergate's collapse. I think this could have significant implications for crypto regulations in the U.S. and banks' ability to deal with digital asset platforms and cryptocurrency brokerages.""
""Silvergate's demise was not a crypto problem. It was clearly due to Silvergate not having enough cash leading to the lack of capital from the bank run.""
View 2 more stories 
""Traditional banks have refused to engage with crypto companies due to a lack of clear rules, leaving a gap that was filled by a few banks willing to take the risk.""
""One of the largest of these banks was Silvergate, which positioned itself as a crypto-friendly institution. However, this concentration on one player proved to be risky.""
""It's definitely not good for the crypto industry, and this could potentially mean a certain trend towards crypto moving outside the U.S., at least until a more comprehensive regulatory framework is established in the U.S.""
""It's difficult to know what the ultimate outcome and time-line of this (winding down) process will be.""
""Silvergate still has a $205 million outstanding term loan to Microstrategy as far as we are aware; while this loan was significantly over-collateralized with BTC and performing as of year-end, we don't have insight into how, or at what value this loan could be liquidated at.""
""In order for events like FTX and Silvergate to be avoided in the future, crypto financial intermediaries need to come into compliance with the federal securities laws. The domino effect from FTX, and the spillover now into the traditional financial system, underscores the need for there to be proper oversight of this industry.""
""This would entail licensing crypto financial intermediaries under the securities laws and oversight by the SEC, and doing this should prevent the kind of debacles that led to the bank run on Silvergate in the first place.""
""There's clearly a regulation-by-enforcement push by federal agencies in the United States – dubbed Operation Chokepoint 2.0 – that is making it harder for crypto-focused financial institutions to operate. Indeed, this pressure is making it increasingly challenging for crypto businesses and traders to operate within the United States.""
""As a result, there will likely continue to be a significant brain and investment drain from the United States to other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong, the UK, Europe and Dubai, which appear to be embracing this revolutionary technology.""

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Fed's Barr says crypto needs 'guardrails' to realize benefits,Pete Schroeder,2023-03-09 20:49:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The top regulatory official for the U.S. Federal Reserve said cryptocurrency technology still could have ""potential transformative"" effects on the financial system, but needs ""guardrails"" to realize them.
Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said recent turmoil in crypto markets make clear the sector could still pose a risk to traditional banks, but that the impact has been limited as regulators urge caution.
U.S. bank regulators, including the Fed, have taken several steps in recent months to ensure banks are approaching the crypto sector with caution, including requiring banks to flag any crypto activities to regulators before proceeding, and warning firms that crypto deposits can be particularly volatile.
""These liquidity concerns are particularly acute for banks that have a meaningful portion of their balance sheets funded with such deposits,"" said Barr in prepared remarks, which came one day after crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) announced plans to liquidate after facing dramatic losses.

Barr stopped short of saying banks have no role to play in crypto, but rather said regulators are busy figuring out what firms could do in the space while remaining safe and sound. He noted that technology behind crypto could make financial markets and payments systems more efficient and affordable.
""Our goal is to create guardrails, while making room for innovation that can benefit consumers and the financial system more broadly,"" he said.

Overall more than $3.2 billion was transferred through payments and loans to company founders and key employees, FTX said in a statement on Wednesday.
These payments were made chiefly from Alameda Research hedge fund, FTX said, adding that it made these disclosures by filing schedules and statements of financial affairs with the bankruptcy court.
The crypto exchange said the transfers did not include over $240 million spent to purchase luxury property in the Bahamas, political and charitable donations made directly by the FTX debtors, and substantial transfers to non-debtor units in the Bahamas and other jurisdictions.
A lawyer for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.
FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November, saying it was unable to completely repay customers who had deposited funds on its exchange. FTX's new CEO, John Ray, has said his top priority was recovering assets to repay FTX customers.  read more

Global business activity data will provide the latest insight into how protracted a slowdown could prove, Britain's FTSE flirts with record highs and Japan, New Zealand and Australia release inflation numbers.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Lewis Krauskopf and Ira Iosebashvili in New York, and Naomi Rovnick and Alun John in London.
The U.S. government hit its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit amid a spat between the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and President Joe Biden's Democrats over raising the country’s debt ceiling - a standoff that could lead to a fiscal crisis, or at worst a default within months.
Immediate fallout might be limited, but risks will emerge closer to June, when the government approaches the date beyond which the Treasury will likely have exhausted emergency manoeuvres to stave off default.

Legislative fights over the limit this last decade have largely been resolved before they hurt markets. But a lengthy standoff in 2011 prompted S&P to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time.
U.S. credit default swaps - an instrument used to insure against default - have hit decade highs in recent days.
Results from the megacap tech and growth companies will test the nascent new year's rebound in tech shares.
Microsoft (MSFT.O), the second biggest U.S. company by market value, reports on Tuesday followed by Elon Musk's Tesla (TSLA.O) on Wednesday - and that's just the warm up for Apple, the top U.S. firm and Google-parent Alphabet the week after. All told, companies worth more than half the S&P 500's market value are reporting results over the next two weeks.
Earnings season has had a tepid start. S&P 500 companies are expected to post an overall 2.6% drop in Q4 earnings versus the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Other market-moving catalysts could come from economic data, including new home sales on Thursday and the personal consumption expenditures index on Friday.
Could this be the end of bear market rallies? Global stocks remain nearly 20% below their January 2022 record high. But MSCI's global share index is also on its longest winning streak since the depths of the bear market last October, as traders bet on economic conditions improving.
All eyes will be on purchasing managers indexes summarising executives' views of the business climate, to see if the global economy really is heading somewhere less gloomy.
The JPMorgan Global Composite PMI in December lingered below the 50 benchmark separating expansion from contraction. It was also, at 48.2, a few ticks above November's 29-month low.
Stock markets can predict the global PMI levels, tending to bounce ahead of a sustainable rise of the index. Improvements in PMI readings from developed economies will likely increase risk appetite. Another downturn may cause the bears to roar again.
The Bank of Japan just sent a strong signal to the bond market: stop betting that the end of stimulus is near.
But data could fuel market speculation. Inflation renewed a more than four-decade high nationwide last month, and double the BOJ's 2% target. January figures for Tokyo could push even higher when they're released on Jan. 27.
While Japanese government bond yields remain subdued following the BOJ's unanimous decision to keep the status quo on Wednesday, currency markets tell a different story. The yen retraced most of its big, knee-jerk drop on the same day of the decision, and is hovering near seven-month highs.
On Wednesday, watch out for Australian and New Zealand inflation data as well, with the RBNZ pondering how much more to tighten, and the RBA wondering whether it's time to pause.
London's bluechip FTSE 100 index (.FTSE) is poised to launch a new attempt to scale an all-time high in days to come.
The rally is a sign, at least in part, that the so-called ""moron premium"" which weighed on British assets after the political turmoil of autumn 2022 is easing.
That's not the only thing helping the index outperform peers - its heavy weighting of miners and other commodity-focused stocks has received a boost from China's reopening.
The fact it is only just about to match its May 2018 record reflects the FTSE's weakness in recent years: The S&P 500 (.SPX) hit its record top in January 2022 and is currently 40% above May 2018 levels.
British public sector borrowing numbers, producer price inflation and PMI data are all due as well ahead of a Bank of England meeting the following week.

Take Five,/business/take-five/,Take Five: Much to say in Tokyo (and Davos),Reuters,2023-01-16 07:05:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MCDRHXCL6NMEFFGIONZXFYJB5M.jpg,"LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Japan's central bank looks set to raise its inflation forecasts and debate further policy tweaks, just as business leaders and policymakers descend (in person this time) on the Swiss resort of Davos to put the world to rights.
U.S. earnings and retail sales numbers, a slew of China data and inflation readings elsewhere mean there's plenty to mull over.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Tom Westbrook in Singapore, Ira Iosebashvili in New York and Amanda Cooper and Karin Strohecker in London.
The Bank of Japan concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday and investors bet it will blink, just four weeks after stunning markets by doubling the size of the band it allows 10-year bond yields (JGB) to move around zero.
The benchmark yield soared as high as 0.54% on Friday, punching through the 0.5% ceiling for the first time after butting against it in previous sessions. A media report that officials will examine the bond market distortions from massive BOJ stimulus appears to have been the final straw. The yen hit a fresh seven-month peak.

And the case for ultra-easy policy certainly seems to be weakening. Recent data showed Tokyo inflation at double the central bank's target. And Japanese workers will hope a decision by Uniqlo's parent company to hike wages as high as 40% will set a trend.
A record number of world leaders, policy makers and top corporate chiefs head to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss ski resort of Davos Jan 16-20.
The mood is sombre as attendees grapple with the cost of living crisis, the threat of natural disasters and extreme weather events, geo-economic confrontation and failure to mitigate climate change - the top risks over the next two years according to a survey of WEF members.
Also looming is the first anniversary of Russia's war in Ukraine, which has rocked a global economy still reeling from the fallout of COVID-19.
ECB chief Christine Lagarde, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg and Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He are all expected to attend.
U.S. retail sales data and more earnings reports are on tap. And investors, who have pushed up the S&P 500 almost 4% so far this month after the index's worst annual decline since 2008 last year, are paying attention (.SPX).
Retail sales saw their biggest decrease in 11 months for November and a second such drop would provide further evidence that aggressive Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes are now cooling the economy.
Economists expect a 0.5% decline in December's number, due out on Jan. 18, after a 0.6% decrease in November.
Investors are also watching corporate results to see if U.S. companies can beat estimates, which have been heftily reduced since October. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley report earnings on Tuesday, and Procter & Gamble and Netflix, on Thursday.
The new lunar year of the rabbit is almost here, with COVID-19 spreading unchecked through China.
Before then comes December's data deluge, with industrial output (CNIO=ECI), retail sales (CNRSL=ECI) and Q4 economic growth data (CNGDP=ECI) lining up to be ugly. Economists expect retail sales to have dropped 7.8% for a fourth straight monthly decline and for annual growth to finish up at a meagre 1.8%.
Markets, hoping that China's rapid reopening will take the sting out of global recession risks, may have to be patient.
Just as much focus will be on the two billion journeys expected to carry passengers to their hometowns to celebrate. Mainland markets close for the following week, but holiday anecdotes on willingness to travel, spend and mingle might guide their expectations about how the reopening will unfold.
With every new inflation print, investors are more convinced the worst of the global price squeeze is over. That's not least because, come spring and a year on from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the numbers will show a much smaller rise and, in some cases, even a decline.
Headline numbers might be flattered by quite how bad things were last year, but under the surface, core inflation is still climbing. And this number is what keeps central bankers awake at night.
A final read of euro zone inflation for December, as well as readings from Britain, Canada and Japan are due. Core inflation in all four regions is mostly rising and above target. The worst may have passed, but it's likely to mark the end of the beginning, rather than the beginning of the end.

A raft of data should shed light on some of those trends and tribulations, while in the United States the earnings season begins.

Consensus analyst estimates call for a 1.6% decline in S&P 500 Q4 earnings versus the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv IBES. Some reckon 2023 projections are still too rosy given recession risks.
Meanwhile, the December U.S. consumer price index is out on Thursday. Any signs that inflation continues to ease will not only reinforce the ""peak rates"" view, but could fuel talk that rate cuts could come later this year.
Investors will have a keen eye on Tokyo's inflation numbers on Tuesday, the data point that first tipped the market to a potential Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy shift.
The Tokyo data - which front-runs the national numbers, often by several weeks - surged to a four-decade high in the previous reading on Nov. 25.
Less than a month later, the BOJ raised the tolerance ceiling for Japan's 10-year government bond yield, catching market players wrong-footed.
The yen has strengthened to seven-month highs on rising expectations for a further hawkish shift, even as BOJ officials maintain the move was a one-off. Their next policy decision comes on Jan. 18.
Australia's inflation data follows on Wednesday, and could be crucial for a Reserve Bank board that is finely poised between pausing rate hikes and accelerating them.
Crude oil markets are off to a rocky start, kicking off 2023 with a near double-digit tumble in the worst start to a year in three decades. The outlook is far from certain.
Worries about a recession, especially in the world's top two consumers - the United States and China, weigh heavily.
But potential supply chain problems could provide support. Insuring vessels to ship Kazakh crude, a replacement option for Russian crude for European consumers, via the Black Sea could prove more expensive and challenging. A waiver for Russian oil shipments subject to a price cap introduced in early December runs out on Jan. 19. After that, sanctions kick in for shipments breaching regulations.
With crude oil volatility soaring, 2023 might be anything but plain sailing for producers and consumers alike.
Transport and public sector strikes, a softening housing market, red-hot inflation and consumers too fearful to spend. That's the backdrop for November UK economic output data on Friday, likely confirming that a lengthy recession is coming.
Following nine consecutive rate rises by the Bank of England, and more to come, British mortgage approvals sunk to their lowest level in November since the coronavirus-induced market slump of June 2020, recent data showed.
As price pressures and higher borrowing costs bite, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce public debt and cut health service waiting lists.
Still, Deutsche Bank sees high inflation persisting this year, no rate cuts until 2024 and fiscal policies becoming more austere. Barclays expects the UK economy to keep contracting until the end of the third quarter of 2023.
For the euro area at least, the first green shoots of economic hope are emerging.
Inflation is tumbling, thanks to a decline in wholesale natural gas and power prices. Gas storage tanks boast healthy inventory levels and temperatures are mild, after a vicious cold snap in early December.
Dutch natural gas futures , a benchmark for the region, have wiped out all the gains made after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last February.
It takes time for declines in market prices to filter through into household bills, but signs are positive for cash-strapped consumers and businesses. Average fuel prices are down sharply from the highs of mid-2022 as well.
Economic recovery may still be a way off but the anticipated recession might not be quite as bad as expected - gas prices and data releases in coming days will no doubt be watched closely.

Even the uber-dovish Bank of Japan has not been spared from investors trying to pick central bank pivot points.
A shock acceleration in Tokyo consumer prices to the fastest pace in 40 years has emboldened some to short Japanese government bonds ahead of Tuesday's policy decision. Speculation was heightened by rare hints from policy board members that it might be time to review ultra-easy stimulus settings.

But BOJ watchers say a shift will not happen until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April after a decade at the helm. There's good reason to take it slow: the recovery is fragile and inflation, while high, is nowhere near European and U.S. levels.
And nationwide CPI data will only be due after the policy decision - made public on Friday.
A cold snap in Europe raises the risk of electricity blackouts that could exacerbate pain inflicted by the energy shock and high inflation. It also tests Europe's resolve to save energy and mitigate the economic impact of the Ukraine war.
Europe's gas storage is almost 90% full after European Union governments acted to build reserves following disruption of Russian supplies, but a series of nuclear outages, especially in France, has added to nervousness of electricty outages.
France is striving to avert power cuts, and Germany is bleeding cash to keep the lights on.
Emmanuel Macron says it was absurd to worry that blackouts would cripple infrastructure, while officials warn of possible outages and France's Banking Federation said cash machines would be affected.
Traders, trying to assess how deep Europe's economic slowdown will prove, should pay attention to the weather report.

Can the United States ward off a recession as consumer prices come off the boil?
Investors get a fresh read-out on the world's top economy and its inflation pressures on Tuesday when November housing starts and existing home sales numbers are due. In October, rising mortgage rates saw U.S. existing home sales sink for a record ninth straight month, home-building fell sharply with single-family projects dropping to a near 2-1/2 year low.
Wednesday will see the Conference Board consumer confidence survey, which slipped to a four-month low in November. The reading for the personal consumption expenditures index is also for release on Dec. 23 after recent inflation data came in softer-than-expected.
A set of emerging market central banks will mark the end to a year in which the scale and pace of rate hikes in developing economies hit multi-year highs.
In emerging Europe, where inflation pressures are still persistent, policy makers in Hungary and the Czech Republic are set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, both of which held rates stable at the last meetings but pledged to tackle inflation.
Thursday has meetings scheduled for Indonesia - where the central bank has just seen growth added to its mandate - as well as Egypt, which is in line for support from the International Monetary Fund. Outlier Turkey is due to make a decision the same day, though watchers expect no change after rates were lowered to single digits ahead of next year's election despite rising inflation.
'Tis the season to be bullish about the year ahead, at least if you sell stocks for a living. With recessions looming in the United States and Europe, however, money managers expect another poor year for equities and are huddling around lower-risk trades.
Investors surveyed by Deutsche Bank predict a 2.2% fall for the S&P 500 next year, citing a worse-than-expected recession.
One trend many agree on is that inflation will subside, powering enthusiasm for U.S. Treasuries and investment grade corporate credit following a rout in 2022.
Expectations of a softer dollar as the U.S. economy slows have sparked optimism about emerging markets, which should also benefit from China easing COVID-19 restrictions. Money managers are widely betting on the yen against the dollar, as speculation mounts that the BoJ will move away from its ultra-dovish monetary policies.

China publishes key economic data as Beijing loosens some of its strict COVID-19 shackles, while PMIs will provide a health check for the global economy.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Dhara Ranasinghe, Naomi Rovnick and Amanda Cooper in London.
Investors will be fed a huge helping of year-end U.S. news when Tuesday's release of November consumer inflation data is followed by the Federal Reserve's last rate decision of 2022 on Wednesday.
October's CPI report showed prices rose less-than-expected at 0.4% from the month before, with signs of slowing inflation boosting equities and knocking the dollar. November's reading is expected at 0.3%. But recent strong U.S. jobs data rekindled inflation fears.

Over to the Fed, where Chair Jerome Powell will hold his last news conference of the year after recent comments that it was time to slow the pace of coming rate rises. Traders are pricing in a 50-basis point (bps) hike - a step down from recent three-quarter percentage point increases. The focus may instead turn to signals for how high the Fed will ultimately raise rates next year.
It's super Thursday in Europe, where central banks in the euro area, Britain, Switzerland and Norway all meet.
Latest inflation numbers have raised hopes that euro zone pressures are finally abating and markets feel confident that after two straight back-to-back 75 bps hikes, the ECB will deliver a 50 bps rate move on Dec. 15.
Don't expect the ECB to sound dovish - pipeline price pressures remain strong and President Christine Lagarde will be careful not to give the impression policy makers are taking their eye off the ball.
It's the same story elsewhere, with Switzerland and Norway also expected to jack up borrowing costs again. The pace of aggressive rate hikes from big central banks is slowing but the fight against inflation is not over yet.
Britain's grim economic situation is unlikely to stop the Bank of England from raising borrowing costs again on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to raise its key rate by 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% despite a looming recession the BoE expects to last well into 2024.
Surging energy and food costs propelled consumer price inflation to a 41-year high of 11.1% in the year to October. Wednesday's UK inflation data may hint at price rises having peaked, following trends in the eurozone and the U.S.
Still, the BoE is likely to resist ending monetary tightening just yet with inflation still well above its 2% target. Swaps markets imply UK interest rates will hit 4.6% by next September and will end 2023 at 4.5%.
After three years of suffocating coronavirus curbs, China can finally breath a little easier. New measures include home quarantine for the COVID-positive instead of isolation centers and no more testing for domestic travel, just in time for a trip to Shanghai's reopened Disneyland.
Wednesday's long-awaited shift has residents, who a week ago were protesting in the streets, now rejoicing on social media. Investors are more sedate. The Hang Seng had its worst day in more than a month that day, selling the fact after a multi-week rally. The yuan is back on the stronger side of the key 7 per dollar mark, but peaked on Monday.
The weakest trade data for 2-1/2 years gave reason for caution, pointing not just to the effects of COVID lockdowns but weaker international demand. Retail and factory data due Thursday could make for further gloomy reading.
A year of the worst inflation in a generation is drawing to a close. With the energy prices now well off the year's highs, businesses and households are getting some respite from eye-watering high inflationary pressures.
But that's unlikely to be enough to avoid a sixth straight month of contraction in business activity in December across some of the world's largest economies. Anything from the manufacturing sector to hospitality has seen demand slump and input prices soar.
S&P Global's flash composite PMI output indices for the United States, Britain, Germany, France and the wider euro zone are expected to show some mild improvement, but activity in all five regions is expected to have declined again. Japan is also on the docket - its manufacturing November PMI staged the sharpest contraction in two years.

Credit Suisse executives may need to sit down for an honest chat about whether the bank's latest strategic plan is enough to rally investors.
Shares in the Zurich-based group hit new lows in recent days as shareholders were asked to pump about 2.2 billion Swiss francs into a restructuring programme aimed at reigning in its embattled investment bank.
The moment of reckoning will come on Thursday when the rights issue closes, potentially leaving the underwriting banks with a big chunk of leftover shares in their books.

As one fund manager put it, there are many other banks trading at discounted valuations with a clearer profitability outlook. Investors face a tough choice.
In a year full of twists and turns, markets know not to take any signs of calm for granted.
Mainland China's biggest wave of civil disobedience since the 1989 Tiananmen protests is the latest curveball thrown at markets. Its impact on Beijing's stringent COVID-19 policies and re-opening of the world's No. 2 economy will be watched closely.
And with the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England meeting in coming weeks, the drama isn't over. Speculation about how quickly a peak in interest rates will come remains in focus.
For some, the notion of peak rates, peak inflation and China's reopening is reason enough for cheer. Emerging stocks just had their best month since 2009. After months of pain inflicted by high inflation and aggressive rate increases, perhaps it's time to bring on the Santa rally.
Monday's U.S. service sector data will provide a signpost on how the economy is faring given 375 basis points of Federal Reserve rate increases to fight decade-high inflation.
October's reading showed that businesses continued to face higher prices for inputs even as the service industry grew at its slowest pace in nearly 2 1/2 years, confirming inflation was shifting to services from goods.
Signs of this trend intensifying could exacerbate worries that higher prices may be more stubborn than expected despite the Fed's all-out efforts.
That shift has also been on Fed chair Jerome Powell's mind, adding to concerns over a tight labour market that will have to be brought back into balance.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is as likely as not to leave rates right where they are on Tuesday, according to traders emboldened by signs of a peak in price pressures.
Inflation unexpectedly slowed in October, and quite sharply, leading money markets to bet it is a coin toss between a pause in the cash rate at 2.85% or another quarter-point bump.
Economists are more confident, unanimously picking an increase. But some now say a move in December could be the last for this cycle.
That wouldn't necessarily cut short a rally in Aussie dollar, which recently has been driven more by China's re-opening hopes and a retreating greenback than the RBA.
Representatives from OPEC+ crude producers agreed at a meeting on Sunday to stick to oil output targets.
They had been expected to gather in person in Vienna for only the second time since the pandemic, but a decision to meet online instead had raised doubts over whether the group would deliver more supply cuts.
The decision comes after the Group of Seven (G7) nations agreed a price cap on Russian oil as well as a Dec. 5 deadline imposed by the bloc for a full embargo on purchases of Moscow's seaborne crude in a move to deprive President Vladimir Putin of revenue.
China's COVID lockdowns have added to pressure on demand and prices. Latest polls predict Brent oil prices will hold above the $100 level a barrel for the rest of 2022, but tick lower to around $93 next year as economic concerns prevail.

And don't forget the turbulence in crypto land, growing concern about China's economic outlook given a COVID-19 resurgence and an extraordinary weekend of protests, plus speculation in the soccer world (that goes beyond predicting the World Cup winner).
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York, Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore, and Alun John, Marc Jones and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
Markets are hopeful the Federal Reserve will soon slow the pace of its aggressive rate hikes. Friday's November jobs data could put that expectation to the test.
The U.S. economy likely created 200,000 new jobs, a Reuters poll of economists forecasts found, in what would be the smallest gain since December 2020. Estimates ranged from 150,000 to 240,000.
View 2 more stories 
A higher-than-expected 261,000 new jobs were created in October, even as the pace of job growth slowed and the unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, suggesting some loosening in labor market conditions.
Still, five of the last six jobs reports have topped consensus estimates and another strong number could spell trouble for U.S. stocks, cooling the S&P 500's 12% rally (.SPX) since mid October. The dollar, weakened by expectations that rates could soon peak, may head higher.
A record number of COVID-19 infections and new lockdowns across China have dampened hopes of a reopening of the world's No.2 economy in the first quarter of 2023.
Protests rippling across the country over the restrictive curbs in scenes unprecedented since President Xi Jinping assumed power a decade ago have added to the woes.
There are, however, other reasons to be hopeful. Regulators have announced a plan to prop up an ailing property sector, and four people with direct knowledge told Reuters China's central bank will offer cheap loans to financial firms to buy bonds issued by property developers.
The authorities also look set to impose a fine of more than $1 billion on Jack Ma's Ant Group, setting the stage for ending the fintech company's two-year long regulatory overhaul.
It's going to be a cold winter, nonetheless.
Manufacturing indicators, mainly PMIs due on Wednesday, might attest to the weakness already seen across the economy. Beijing has hinted at cutting bank reserve requirements to help support the economy. Economists reckon China will do what it takes to get growth above 5% next year.

U.S. inflation may be close to peaking, but euro area price pressures remain strong, Wednesday's preliminary November estimate of inflation in the bloc is likely to show.
Inflation in the euro zone was 10.6% in October, more than five times the European Central Bank's 2% target. An underlying measure stripping out volatile food and energy prices remains well above target.
ECB Vice-President Luis de Guindos warns that the persistency of inflation pressures should not be underestimated. The ECB has hiked rates by 75 basis points at each of its last two meetings, lifting rates by 200 bps to 1.5% in just three months.
Markets price in an 80% chance of another 75 bps hike in December. Indeed, the Fed may be getting ready to slow the pace of its rate hikes, but the ECB is not there yet.
Cryptocurrencies will likely remain under pressure, as the industry nervously waits to see whether any of the dominoes tottering after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX fall over.
Top of mind is crypto broker Genesis, which said on Monday it had ""no immediate plans to file for bankruptcy"", after media reports it was struggling to raise cash for its lending unit.
Bitcoin fell to $15,479 that day - a two-year low - though if anything it has held up better than feared, having largely traded sideways since FTX collapsed.
Crypto markets are in disarray, however, and CME December bitcoin futures are trading around $16,000, while the token itself is around $16,400. That's a massive discount by recent standards.
Maybe World Cup fever is getting everyone excited, but suddenly England's two most storied soccer clubs, Manchester United and Liverpool, are up for grabs to the highest bidder.
AC Milan as well as Roman Abramovich's forced sale of Chelsea have already fetched top dollar this year, so some eye-watering valuations - nearly 7 billion pounds ($8.48 billion) in United' s case - are being banded around for this prized pair.
Both clubs have U.S. owners looking to head down the tunnel, but where potential buyers come in from, particularly at these prices when recessions and trophy droughts loom, is uncertain. Nevertheless, a crowd of billionaires, wealth funds and private equity bankers is cheering from the sidelines.

Take Five,/business/take-five/,Take Five: Black Friday test,Reuters,2022-11-21 07:24:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BYL7ESQPMFMSNNVJSVCYKYTPH4.jpg,"(Reuters) - The most important day for U.S. retailers is here and questions are rife on whether king dollar is set to lose its crown.
Global purchasing managers data will shine a light on the health of the world economy, while markets want to see whether Beijing could step up some of its promised support.
And the World Cup football bonanza is underway in Qatar.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Amanda Cooper, Dara Ranasinghe and Karin Strohecker in London.
With concerns that the U.S. economy may be on the verge of a recession, a key test of consumer demand arrives on Nov. 25, when retailers launch ""Black Friday"" sales - a day traditionally marked by long lines of shoppers eager to pounce on discounts.
Soaring inflation and surging interest rates could test buying appetite.
October U.S. retail sales increased more than expected, boosted by purchases of motor vehicles and a range of other goods, suggesting the consumer may be on more solid footing heading into year-end. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Retailers have offered mixed results in the most recent earnings season. Just this week, Walmart (WMT.N) lifted its annual sales and profit forecast as demand for groceries was expected to hold up despite higher prices, while Target (TGT.N) forecast a surprise drop in holiday-quarter sales.
The rise of the U.S. dollar has been the dominant trading theme of 2022, thanks to the Federal Reserve's quest to raise interest rates to quell inflation, giving the currency an edge over its peers among investors, who have been starved of any kind of yield for at least a decade.
October's inflation report delivered evidence that consumer price pressures have slowed for the past four straight months from June's 41-year peak of 9.1%. The dollar index, meanwhile, peaked at a 20-year high of 114.78 in September and has been falling ever since.
Now, it's heading for its biggest quarterly loss since the second quarter of 2017, having shed 4.5% in value. The time may be fast approaching for dollar bears to emerge from hibernation.
The International Monetary Fund says the global economic outlook is even gloomier than it was a month ago. Is the pessimism justified? Preliminary readings of business activity in November from a number of economies could answer the question in the coming days.
Manufacturing PMIs for October pointed to a deepening contraction in global industry, with developed markets leading the decline. In most European countries, PMIs are below the 50 marker that separates expansion from contraction -- France was an exception.
Britain is already facing a lengthy recession. Euro zone economic growth has held up better than expected and labour markets remain relatively robust. But the risk of recession is still elevated for a region grappling with an energy shock and higher costs for anything from financing to wages.
The Chinese central bank's pledge to step up supportive policy measures are in focus, though policymakers kept benchmark lending rates steady for a third straight month on Monday. Some had expected a cut in the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), though no change suggests the bank remains wary of stoking further yuan weakness by easing monetary conditions.
Stocks and industrial metal markets had cheered signs of pro-growth initiatives, from help for the beleaguered property market to, crucially, an easing of choking zero-COVID policies.
But the COVID outlook remains murky. Noises from Beijing are that ""life-saving"" measures are essential, which argues against making too much of a two-day reduction in quarantine times. Students in schools across several Beijing districts buckled down for online classes after officials called for residents in some of its hardest-hit areas to stay home.
Other regional central banks will also be setting rates. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is tipped for a super-sized 75 basis point hike on Wednesday, while the Bank of Korea is seen tightening again, but possibly only by a quarter of a point.
The football World Cup is finally underway - an event marred by controversy since Qatar was awarded hosting rights 12 years ago, including allegations of corruption and human rights violations.
Qatar has much riding on the tournament passing off smoothly - hoping to affirm Doha's place on the global stage and for an economic boost.
Higher consumption, government spending and services exports are all positives for the Gulf state that has seen its growth outlook trail some of its peers in a region buffeted by high crude prices. But it remains to be seen how long these effects might last, according to analysts.

Take Five,/business/take-five/,Take Five: A UK budget and trouble in crypto land,Reuters,2022-11-14 07:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5273NYHYURP3ZDKX7OFDSMCQAE.jpg,"LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The long-awaited UK fiscal plan is (almost) here and after the ructions unleashed by September's mini-budget, markets are paying close attention.
Chaos reigns in cryptoland as trouble at cryptocurrency exchange FTX resonates, while latest U.S. and China data comes just as hopes of a peak in interest rates grows.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Elizabeth Howcroft, Tom Wilson, Amanda Cooper and Mike Dolan in London, Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore and Ira Iosebashvili in New York.
The moment sterling traders have been waiting for is almost here. On Nov. 17, finance minister Jeremy Hunt unveils the government's fiscal plan.
September's mini-budget from predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng brought the pound to its knees and forced the Bank of England to intervene to stem a rout in the bond market.
Hunt has since junked most of that plan, and signalled some 60 billion pounds ($68.70 billion) in tax rises and spending cuts are coming to plug a gaping hole in the public finances.

UK markets have recouped most of the maxi-losses from the mini-budget, but the outlook is grim. The economy faces its longest recession in a century, as a cost-of-living crisis bites.
Latest inflation and jobs numbers are also on the calendar. Inflation hit a blistering 10.1% in September and there's little reason to expect much of a respite.
The crypto world has been thrown into fresh chaos by a meltdown at FTX, with the fallout reverberating across other exchanges and parts of the crypto universe.
On Friday, major exchange FTX said it would start U.S. bankruptcy proceedings while its Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried resigned.
A proposed rescue deal from rival exchange Binance fell through on Wednesday, sending top cryptocurrency bitcoin below $16,000 for the first time since late 2020.
Crypto investors are in a state of shock - FTX founder Bankman-Fried was seen by many as the ""poster child"" of the industry. Investors crypto markets have already taken a beating this year as central banks reverse pandemic-era monetary policy. Concerns are also rising about the future of the crypto industry, which faces an uphill task of regaining favour among retail investors.
This year's Big Tech equity plunge shows little sign of ending - dogged by squeezed consumer real incomes, recession fears and a valuation rethink due to the soaring interest rates that discount their future revenues to today's price.
After warnings about online advertising and streaming services littered the third quarter earnings season, mass layoffs are now emerging. Meta Platforms (META.O) just announced it would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce.
That's among the biggest this year and follows job cuts at other tech firms including Elon Musk-owned Twitter, Microsoft, (MSFT.O) and Snap . Big banks too are starting to pare back staffing levels.
Markets are watching closely to see if others follow - and try to gauge whether this is merely retrenchment from over-exuberant, pandemic-distorted staffing levels or the thin end of the wedge that deepens any oncoming recession. Central banks will be watching like hawks too.
Wednesday's U.S. October retail sales should provide markets with a sense of how consumers are faring ahead of the key holiday shopping season.
And remember the Federal Reserve is intent on hiking interest rates to contain hot inflation, even if that means a squeeze on consumption in the process.
September data showed a measure of underlying retail sales rising thanks to strong wage gains and savings, even as the broader number came in flat. Analysts polled by Reuters expect a 0.8% increase for October.
The good-news-is-bad news crowd would likely see a strong number as evidence that the Fed has more work to do in cooling the economy. That outlook is unlikely to bring joy to markets battered by expectations of more monetary policy tightening this year.
Chinese shares (.SSEC) are celebrating Beijing easing some of its draconian COVID rules, including shortening quarantines by two days for close contacts of infected people and for inbound travellers. This comes despite cases on the mainland at 6-month highs and some big cities under fresh lockdowns.
Upcoming data will be a rude reminder of the toll the strict COVID policy has been taking: retail sales are falling, industrial production has been hurt by strict lockdowns during last month's 20th Party Congress, and property sales are in an extended decline.
The glass-half full view sees green shoots in promises the authorities have made on growth and hopes for more policy support. One test is whether China's central bank renews a massive trillion yuan in medium term loans to banks, maturing on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Chinese leader Xi Jinping arrived on the Indonesian island of Bali on Monday for a long-awaited meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, ahead of a Group of 20 summit set to be fraught with tension over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Take Five,/business/take-five/,Take Five: No time to COP out,Reuters,2022-11-07 08:00:00+00:00,,"LONDON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Politics are back on top of financial markets' agenda with U.S. midterm elections and COP27 getting underway, while U.S. inflation data will provide fresh clues on how elusive that pivot from the Federal Reserve and other central banks might be.
Meanwhile, China will release a deluge of data as markets try to read the runes on how Beijing might shape its COVID policy in future.
Here's a look at the week ahead in markets from Tom Westbrook in Singapore, Ira Iosebashvili in New York, and Dhara Ranasinghe and Simon Jessop in London.
Don't forget the politics as the U.S. gears up for midterm elections on Nov. 8 where control of Congress and President Joe Biden's agenda for the two years remaining in his term are at stake.
U.S. stocks have performed better in periods of divided government, a result that seems increasingly likely with Republicans favoured to wrest control of the House of Representatives, and possibly the Senate.
Average annual S&P 500 returns have been 14% in a split Congress and 13% in a Republican-held Congress under a Democratic president, compared with 10% when Democrats controlled both presidency and Congress.

Midterms have also historically ushered in a long period of gains in U.S. stocks – a development many would cheer after the past year's tumble in the S&P 500.
On Thursday, it's time for U.S. inflation numbers - a data set that's proven to be an important turning point for markets this year as consumer prices surged to decades high peaks.
Investors will once again be looking for signs that price pressures are slowing after a barrage of rate hikes. Yet the world's foremost central bank just said the ultimate benchmark policy rate level will likely be higher than previously estimated to tame inflation, underlining the threat that rising prices pose to the economy.
A stronger-than-expected reading will likely weigh on stocks and bonds, potentially ramping up expectations that policymakers will need to get even more hawkish. A Reuters poll showed analysts expecting inflation to rise by 0.7% month-on-month.

After over 2,300 basis points worth of rate hikes in the current tightening cycle from ten big developed economies, markets had hoped for a dovish pivot to take away the sting.
No chance. The Fed and Bank of England just delivered big 75 basis point (bps) rate increases and with inflation stubbornly high, the message from central banks is clear - more hikes are needed.
But just maybe those moves could be less aggressive, as comments from Fed chief Jerome Powell suggested. Australia's central bank has already slowed the pace of its rate hikes and delivered a mere 25 bps hike on Tuesday. Data and central bank comments in days ahead will remain under scrutiny. The much-hoped for dovish pivot remains elusive and battered world markets may have to settle for more but less for now.
Reopening rumours made an excuse for buying China in recent days, but the weight of money is on the sidelines watching for the economy - especially sentiment and spending - to show signs of a turning point. Data on Monday showed China's exports and imports unexpectedly contracted in October, the first simultaneous slump since May 2020 (CNTRD=ECI).
Inflation (CNCPI=ECI) and credit data (CNTYLY=ECI) due in days to come may give a glimpse of that progress.
But the most intense focus may fall on foreign exchange reserves, which are being soaked up as authorities seek to put the brakes on a currency heading for its worst year since 1994.
Down eight months in a row, China's reserves (CNFXM=ECI) are within a whisker of the psychological $3 trillion level. A drop below would be a mirror on dollar strength, and perhaps the depth of resolve to resist it in North Asia, where reserves are draining from Seoul to Taipei and Tokyo.
Climate issues take centre-stage as world leaders kick off the COP27 talks on reining in emissions in Egypt's coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.
With the conflict in Ukraine, food and energy supply issues and surging inflation dominating the agenda, expectations for progress have focused less on fresh commitments to lower emissions and more on keeping the show on the road.
Crucial to that will be what steps the developed world takes towards helping poorer countries cut emissions and adapt their economies to its effects and pay for damage caused.
Also expected are updates and new commitments on a range of pledges made last year in Glasgow, including on deforestation, methane and carbon markets.

Wall Street's latest rally is underpinned by some hopes the Fed will react to softer economic data by easing up on their aggressive rate hikes. Fed chair Jerome Powell has come under political pressure to be careful of putting U.S. jobs at risk by tightening policy too much.
A consequential week for markets also includes Friday's October U.S. payrolls report, with economists polled by Reuters forecasting the economy created 200,000 new jobs.
The Bank of England looks set to raise rates by the most since 1989 on Thursday with a 75 bps increase baked into market expectations.
That is down from near-100% bets on a full percentage-point leap in the Bank Rate which were doused last week by new finance minister Jeremy Hunt when he reversed almost all of former Prime Minister Liz Truss's tax cuts.
But the delay of the first budget plan of Hunt and new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak until Nov. 17 will make it harder for the BoE to spell out its economic forecasts.
After delays caused by Britain's recent market mayhem, the BoE is also due to start selling bonds from its stimulus stockpile on Tuesday.
In the euro area, the October flash inflation estimate on Monday surged past expectations yet again to hit a record high. Inflation in the bloc hit 10.7%, accelerating from 9.9% last month and dashing hopes that peak inflation could be near.
The European Central Bank just delivered its second 75 bps rate increase to control price pressures.
Even if signs of peak inflation do emerge soon, policymakers and markets will wait to see if underlying price pressures are broadening out.
Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was at 6% in September - well above the ECB's 2% target. No wonder some ECB officials are keen to take monetary tightening further by winding down the bonds the ECB holds on its balance sheet.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is under pressure ahead of Tuesday's policy gathering.
Its decision to slow hikes to a quarter point clip earlier this month reverberated through global markets as investors began to consider peak rates might be near.
But data on Wednesday showing a shock jump in Aussie inflation to a 32-year peak suggests the RBA has thrown itself behind the curve, and beckons Governor Philip Lowe to perform an embarrassing about-face.
The Aussie dollar's reaction has been fairly subdued so far, but a sudden shift back to a hawkish policy outlook should provide some welcome support to a currency that has been battered by global equity market angst and China growth worries.
Former President Lula da Silva won Sunday's presidential election with 50.9% of votes versus 49.1% for sitting President Jair Bolsonaro, marking a stunning comeback and the end of Brazil's most right-wing government in decades.
Brazilian financial markets may be in for a volatile week with investors examining speculation about his cabinet and the risk of Bolsonaro questioning results.
Brazil's currency was higher in early Monday trading.
The real remains the best performing free-floating emerging market currency in Latin America versus the U.S. dollar so far this year.

Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt is due to deliver a new budget on Oct. 31. He faces the uphill task of finding tens of billions of pounds in spending cuts - in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis - to rescue Britain's battered fiscal reputation, with currency and fixed income markets in the doldrums.
The Bank of Japan meets on Oct. 28 and is expected to continue running against the grain of global central banks by sticking to its extraordinary levels of stimulus - even as its policy exacerbates a politically unpopular plunge in the yen to a 32-year low beyond 150 per dollar.
Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market on Friday to buy yen for the second time in a month, and likely did so again on Monday. The BOJ conducted emergency bond buying last week to keep a lid on yields, showing its commitment to easing.
In Australia, the monetary policy outlook is much murkier. The Reserve Bank's decision in October to slow the pace of rate hikes reverberated in global markets, leading some to say the peak of policy tightening worldwide might be reached soon.
Recent data has backed the case for a slower pace of hikes with Australian employment numbers posting a disappointingly small rise in September. That put the spotlight on quarterly inflation data due on Wednesday that could help determine the next policy move.
The ECB is widely expected to deliver its second supersized 75 basis-point rate hike on Thursday. Joining the global rate-hike party late, the ECB has delivered 125 bps worth of rises in two meetings in its fastest pace of policy tightening on record.
With euro area inflation at almost 10% versus an ECB target of 2%, there's little appetite to slow down now, even if recession risks are rising.
In fact, expect ECB chief Christine Lagarde to face plenty of questions about when the central bank will start scaling back its bondholdings in the next tightening phase. Policymakers are also believed to be closing in on a deal to change the rules governing loans to banks that have benefited from a sudden jump in rates.
More than 300 S&P 500 companies are due to report results over the next two weeks as the U.S. third-quarter earnings season heats up. Reports from companies such as Goldman Sachs, Lockheed Martin, Bank of America and Netflix have heartened investors in those firms' shares.
Still, overall S&P 500 earnings growth is only expected to have climbed 3% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. That would be the worst performance in two years and is down from an expectation of 4.5% at the start of October.
Faltering profit growth would remove a key pillar that has helped shelter U.S. stock markets from more severe declines. Among companies due to report in the coming week are the four largest in the U.S. by market value: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
It's a different story in Europe, where soaring costs of energy, raw materials, labour and credit and tangled supply chains are chipping away at earnings expectations.
Nonetheless, a different lockdown sequencing and favourable currency effects mean companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 regional index are expected to report a rise of about 28.4% in earnings in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Nonetheless, that's down from an expected 32% jump pre-reporting season and a whopping 60% growth in Q3 2021.
So far results have been mixed: Telecom equipment makers Nokia and Ericsson missed analysts' expectations, but on a brighter note Birkin bag maker Hermes saw a sharp rise in sales growth, and the world's second-biggest spirits group Pernod Ricard beat expectations.

The Bank of England is no longer be the buyer of last resort of battered British bonds
The government's ""mini-Budget"" on Sept. 23 sparked some of the biggest ever jumps in UK bond yields, spooked wider markets and triggered a crisis among pension funds needing to find bucket loads of cash.
The BoE has been forced to intervene repeatedly to ensure financial stability, even as those measures contradict its task of fighting inflation by jacking up interest rates and selling some of the bonds it owns.

On top of UK turmoil, unease triggered by decades-high inflation, an energy shock and aggressive global rate hikes are putting markets through a stress test.
The carnage in British gilts has exposed vulnerabilities in the pensions sector, shining a light on financial stability risks. So, the coming days will see increased focus on other possible hot spots that have gone under the radar of regulators.

The third-quarter U.S. earnings season heats up as companies report results in the throes of a difficult operating environment given a strengthening dollar and surging inflation.
Earnings for S&P 500 companies overall are expected to have climbed 4.1% from the year-earlier period, which would be the slowest growth since the fourth quarter of 2020.
But more focus may be on how executives project the future; consensus analyst estimates are for a nearly 8% rise in profits next year, according to Refinitiv IBES, but many investors are dubious of that forecast as recession risks loom.
A market slide has moderated stock valuations, but a downgrade in the earnings outlook could dampen equities' attractiveness. Upcoming earnings reports includes results from Tesla, Netflix and Johnson & Johnson.
China's twice-a-decade Communist party congress kicked off on Sunday, and the week-long, closed-door assembly is set to hand Xi Jinping an unprecedented third five-year term as supreme leader.
It puts Xi in a position to pursue his vision for the ""rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" which includes the ""common prosperity"" policies that toppled behemoths including Alibaba and Evergrande. A desire to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control is also ramping up tensions with Washington.
Xi at the weekend called for accelerating the building of a world-class military while touting the fight against COVID-19.
As for the economy, Xi has let that fall victim to other priorities: growth is set to miss a 5.5% target after repeated lockdowns under the zero-COVID programme. The latest reading of gross domestic product is due Tuesday, after growth ground to a virtual halt in the second quarter.
Hopes of pandemic controls relaxing at this congress could prove unfounded, considering how Beijing met a flare-up in cases just beforehand by barring many travelers in the recent Golden Week holiday from returning to the capital.
Traders are back on currency intervention watch as the dollar scales fresh 24-year peaks to the yen and heads back towards multi-year highs versus the Chinese yuan and Korean won.
Japan's currency careened to the cusp of 147 per dollar on Wednesday, crashing through the trough at 145.89 that spurred the Bank of Japan to intervene last month to support the yen for the first time since 1998.
South Korea also sold billions of dollars last quarter to prop up its currency, as the won plumbed a 13-year low just shy of 1,445 per dollar last month. Even so, it's not strayed far from there, nearing 1,440 last week.
China's state banks stepped up their intervention to defend a weakening yuan on Monday. And traders are jittery over more aggressive steps to come.
And there was no sign from G7 economies meeting in Washington of joint intervention to ease the pain of a soaring dollar.

World at Work,/business/world-at-work/,French government to trigger special procedure to adopt pension bill without vote - source,Elizabeth Pineau,2023-03-16 14:18:00+00:00,,"PARIS, March 16 (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne will trigger a special constitutional procedure to push an unpopular pension reform bill through the National Assembly without a vote, the Elysee said on Thursday.
The move, using the so-called article 49.3 of the constitution, will ensure the bill raising the retirement age by two years to 64 is adopted, but it shows President Emmanuel Macron and his government failed to garner enough of a majority in parliament.
Resorting to the measure is likely to further enrage unions, protesters and left-wing opposition parties that say the pension overhaul is unfair and unnecessary.
""This government is not worthy of our Fifth Republic, of French democracy. Until the very end, parliament has been ridiculed, humiliated,"" Fabien Roussel, head of the French Communist Party said.
Socialist Party head Olivier Faure told Reuters earlier on Thursday that such a move could unleash ""an uncontrollable anger"" after weeks of rolling strikes and protests.

Opposition parties are likely to request a vote of no confidence in the government, however that is unlikely to pass as most conservative lawmakers would likely back the government.
Borne was greeted by boos as she arrived in the National Assembly to announce the special procedure. The session was suspended for two minutes after left-wing lawmakers singing the national anthem prevented Borne from speaking.
Some brandished placards reading ""No to 64 years.""
Macron and his government say raising the retirement age is necessary to get the pension system out of the red by the end of the decade.
His failure to get the pension overhaul passed by a majority in parliament is not only a serious blow to his reformist credentials, but it risks destroying much of his political capital for the rest of his second mandate, which runs until 2027.

The employee-owned company, which runs John Lewis department stores and grocer Waitrose, also flagged an uncertain outlook as customers struggle with higher prices, prompting some to switch to cheaper outlets.
It is the second time the annual bonus has been axed since 2020.
Sharon White, who chairs the partnership, said on a call with reporters that the cost-cutting measures were aimed at boosting efficiency and productivity. She did not specify how many workers, known as partners, would be let go.
The business reported a loss of 234 million pounds ($283 million) in the 12 months to Jan. 28 compared to a loss of 27 million a year earlier, which it said was largely due to property write downs.

The loss before exceptional items and tax was 78 million pounds, compared to a profit of 181 million pounds in the same period a year earlier.
The impact of inflation added 179 million pounds to its costs, finance director Bérangère Michel told reporters.
British households have been battling double-digit inflation since September and the government's official budget forecaster said on Wednesday that the country remained on track for a record fall in living standards over the two years to March 2024.
Total sales fell 2% to 12.3 billion pounds, led by a 3% drop in Waitrose sales, which has lost market share to cheaper rivals Aldi and Lidl.
John Lewis sales rose 0.2% to 4.9 billion pounds, helped by stronger fashion and beauty offerings with items including work and holiday wear performing well.
The 159-year-old retail group has been struggling in recent years amid tough competition and the costs of developing its online offering.
White - in the middle of a five-year recovery plan - on Wednesday appointed Nish Kankiwala as the company's first ever chief executive to help turn around its fortunes.
Looking ahead, White said the group was confident it could return to a profit in the coming year as inflation cools.
""As far as the plan is concerned, we're on track,"" she said.

World at Work,/business/world-at-work/,Nissan workers in Tennessee to decide whether to form small union,Daniel Wiessner,2023-03-16 10:22:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NEXCZBYPWJNQXKHBR7K6S6IWTU.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - Technicians at Nissan Motor Co's (7201.T) Smyrna plant in Tennessee will vote on Thursday whether to join a union, potentially providing a path to unionize thousands more production workers at the facility.
The 86 tool and die workers would be the first group to unionize at Nissan's largest assembly plant in North America if they vote to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, known as IAM.
Last month, the Democrat-controlled U.S. National Labor Relations Board rejected Nissan's claim that any election should also involve thousands of production-line workers because they share working conditions with the technicians. The Smyrna plant has more than 7,000 employees.
Nissan spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter said the company believed its workplace was stronger without the presence of unions ""that have not been involved in our history of quality job creation and do not understand the relationship we have with Nissan teammates.""

IAM did not respond to requests for comment.
Unions have struggled for decades to unionize the Japanese automaker's Smyrna factory, which opened in 1983, and other auto plants in the U.S. South. In 1989 and 2001, workers in Smyrna voted overwhelmingly against joining the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.
The union strategy of targeting smaller groups of supportive workers as a way to gain a foothold in a workplace is not new, but business groups have been more critical of the tactic over the last decade. They say that smaller bargaining units, which are derisively called ""micro unions,"" fracture workplaces and complicate collective bargaining.
In 2015, UAW won an election to represent 160 skilled trades workers at Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) Chattanooga plant in Tennessee, a year after losing a bid to unionize the entire facility.
Volkswagen challenged the results in court, but the case was sent back to the National Labor Relations Board after board members appointed by former Republican President Donald Trump issued a ruling in a separate case that made it more difficult to form smaller bargaining units. The UAW then withdrew its petition to pave the way for a factory-wide election, which the union narrowly lost in 2019.
The labor board's current Democratic majority reversed the Trump-era precedent in December, restoring a test adopted in 2011 that is seen as favoring unions.
The new test was adopted after IAM filed a petition to represent the Nissan technicians, so it does not apply to the case. But the board last month said that under an older standard the unit was valid because tool and die workers perform a distinct trade from production employees.
If the union wins Thursday's election, Nissan could challenge the results before the labor board and then a federal appeals court, potentially delaying contract talks for years.

World at Work,/business/world-at-work/,Japan's workers get biggest pay rises in decades as inflation surges,Tetsushi Kajimoto,2023-03-15 11:21:00+00:00,,"TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - Top Japanese companies agreed to their largest pay increases in a quarter century at annual labour talks that wrapped up on Wednesday, heeding, at least for now, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's call for higher wages to offset rising living costs.
Worker pay has been a casualty of years of sputtering growth in the world's third-largest economy. Japanese salaries are virtually unchanged since the late 1990s and now well behind the average for the OECD grouping of rich countries.
Kishida has stepped up his call for better pay as a weak yen currency and higher commodities prices have driven up import costs, sending inflation to its highest in four decades.
The average wage increase at ""shunto"" spring wage talks this year was the biggest in about 30 years, according to the Keidanren business lobby, which did not give a more exact figure. That put the increase broadly in line with analysts' expectations for a boost of almost 3%, which would be the biggest since 2.9% in 1997.
View 2 more stories 
""This spring marks a turning point for growth and wealth distribution,"" Kishida told a meeting with representatives of business lobbies and unions, adding that he aimed for a nationwide increase in the minimum wage.
A number of Japan's biggest corporations - including Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) - said they had agreed to the requested increases from unions, results that were widely flagged in recent weeks.
""Given the surge in prices, employee expectations were running higher than most years,"" Hitachi Vice President Kenichi Tanaka told a briefing.
The Rengo labour confederation had called for a 5% pay hike.
This year's talks marked the first time that all of Japan's major automakers had fully accepted union demands, Akihiro Kaneko, the president of an umbrella group of automaker unions, said.
But for workers at smaller companies - which make up almost 70% of Japan's workforce - the outlook was less rosy. Those businesses have often struggled to pass on rising costs to their customers.
""I'm so jealous of workers at companies like Toyota,"" said Takehiro Kato, who works at a truck maker where wages have hardly risen.	His employer recently paid out a one-time allowance to help counter inflation, but that's it.
""You can't count on money like that, because you don't know when you'll get another such payment again,"" Kato said.
It's unclear whether the rising wage trend will be sustainable, let alone create the ""virtuous cycle"" of stronger economic growth and 2% inflation long sought by Japan's central bank.
The Bank of Japan has emphasised the importance of wage growth to steady, manageable inflation. It argues that recent price rises have been from volatile external factors such as higher import costs, rather than improving domestic demand.
In the last year, it has been a standout among major central banks in keeping to ultra-low interest rates. The Japanese economy narrowly averted a recession in the final months of 2022, as consumption remained weak.
""Rather than a change in the stance of companies, this is more a case of a temporary reaction to unexpected and historically high prices,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, a former BOJ board member now an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.
""It is unlikely that wage hikes will just continue next year and after regardless of what happens with prices.""
Big companies had been expected to raise wages by around 2.85%, according to a survey by Japan Economic Research Center. The talks cover both base and bonus pay.
Hitachi said on Wednesdayit would increase overall wages by an average of 3.9%, compared to last year's 2.6% increase.
""We must not make this wage hike just a one-off thing,"" said Masashi Jimbo, president of the Japanese Electrical Electronic & Information Union.
The government held a joint three-party meeting with labour and management for the first time in eight years on Wednesday as Kishida seeks to create an environment of regular - not just one-off - wage increases.
Every March, more than 300 major firms negotiate with their union, following wage pace-setters such as Toyota Motor Corp.
Japanese unions have tended to settle for relatively meagre pay hikes of around 2% in recent years, as they are inclined to cooperate with management in keeping job security rather than demanding bigger pay rises.
Some analysts are also sceptical that unions will be as aggressive in demanding higher pay in coming years if inflation eases, as it is expected to from the middle of the year.
Real wages fell in January at the fastest pace since May 2014 when the sales tax was raised to 8% from 5%.
Japan's wages have grown just about 5% over the last 30 years, far below an average 35% gain among member countries during the same period, OECD data shows.

Incomes Data Research (IDR) said the median pay rise at major British employers had risen from 4.3% in the three months to the end of October and 3.4% in the first quarter of 2022.
""Such relatively high increases are likely to continue further into 2023 due in part to the influence of the forthcoming uplift in the National Living Wage... but continued tight labour markets and elevated inflation will play a role too,"" Zoe Woolacott, senior researcher at IDR, said.
The National Living Wage - a minimum wage rate which does not apply to apprentices or workers aged under 23 - is set to rise by 9.7% at the start of April to 10.42 pounds ($12.67) an hour.

The Bank of England is keeping a wary eye on pay growth, as many of its policymakers fear above-average pay rises will slow the fall in inflation, which hit a 41-year high of 11.1% in October and remains in double digits.
The IDR report also comes out just hours before finance minister Jeremy Hunt presents his annual budget statement, against a backdrop of strikes from doctors, nurses, transport workers and civil servants who are all seeking bigger pay rises.
IDR said its data mostly reflected private-sector wage deals - especially in manufacturing - as few public-sector wage agreements were reached between November and January. In total, the figures include 75 pay deals covering more than half a million workers.
Some of the biggest pay rises included 14% increases for workers at Ford Motor Company and at BMW's MINI car plant.
Official figures published on Tuesday showed wage growth slowed in the quarter to January with basic pay, excluding bonuses up 6.5% compared with a 6.7% rise in the three months to the end of December.

World at Work,/business/world-at-work/,Explainer: Why Japan's 'shunto' spring wage talks are a big deal this year,Tetsushi Kajimoto,2023-03-15 00:51:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OFOB7HOJLBKDVDKQK4GZ3BEW3Q.jpg,"TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - Every March, management of major Japanese firms meet with unions for wage talks across industries that set the tone for employees' pay in the new fiscal year.
The precedent set at the ""shunto"" spring wage talks also influences wages at smaller firms that employ seven out of 10 Japanese workers.
The outcome will have a huge influence on how soon the Bank of Japan (BOJ) can end ultra-low interest rates. Steady wage hikes are crucial to kick-starting domestic demand and keeping inflation sustainably around its 2% target.
In Japan, with the economy entrenched in deflation for 15 years since the recession of the 1990s, people are unable to shake the perception that neither prices nor wages will rise.
Here is an overview of the wage negotiations: and why they are important.
In around March of each year, companies and unions negotiate pay for the fiscal year beginning in April of that year.
The practice, known as ""shunto,"" began in 1956 when Japan's postwar economy was booming. Unions demanded improvement in wages and job conditions by resorting to strikes in big cities, which peaked in the 1960s to 1970s.
View 2 more stories 
The shunto wages eventually peaked in 1974 with a record 33% rise in pay. The increases fell below 3% after Japan slipped into deflation and prolonged economic stagnation in the late 1990s as it suffered its own banking crisis.
Since then, unionists have turned cooperative, rather than combative, working with management on the shared objective of job security.
The focus on job security, rather than higher pay, is blamed for keeping Japan's wage growth stagnant. The share of low-paid part-timers in the workforce has also doubled since the early 1990s, and these so-called non-regular workers now account for nearly 40% of the workforce, putting a drag on pay increases.
The stimulus policies introduced by former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dubbed ""Abenomics"" in the late 2010s helped boost exporters' profits by weakening the yen. But it failed to trickle down to households in terms of wage increases.
Incumbent premier Fumio Kishida wants to change this under his flagship ""new capitalism"" policies that seek to distribute wealth more broadly among the population through higher pay.
He has called on companies to deliver wage hikes that exceed the pace of inflation and help households navigate higher costs from rising fuel and raw material prices.
Companies themselves need to offer higher pay to retain talent and hire young workers as Japan's rapidly ageing population intensifies a labour shortage.
Some of Japan's biggest firms have already promised large pay hikes including auto giant Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and fashion brand Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing
Analysts expect big firms to offer wage hikes of around 3% in wage talks, which would be the fastest pace of increase since 1997 when Japan was on the cusp of deflation. That would follow last year's 2.2% increase, the first hike in four years.
Such increases would meet Kishida's call for 3% rises but fall short of the ambitious 5% demanded by the Rengo labour umbrella group.
The key for the economy will be how much companies will raise base pay, which are across-the-board and permanent payments that provide the basis of future allowances like retirement and pensions.
Wary of increasing fixed costs, many Japanese firms have long opted to pay one-off bonuses in good times rather than raise base pay.
As Japan slid into deflation in the late 1990s, management and unions agreed for more than a decade to no increases in base pay.
Economists projected a 2.85% wage increase in a January poll, with base pay increases accounting for 1.08% and 1.78% from an increase in additional salary, based on seniority.
A survey by the Institute of Labour Administration, a labour think tank, which is known for its correlation with shunto results, showed a rise of 8,590 yen ($64.04), or 2.75%, for an average 439 workers surveyed. Asked whether they would carry out base pay increase, 41.6% said they intended to.
Mizuho Research & Technologies economists foresee declines persisting until 2024 which will weigh on consumption.

World at Work,/business/world-at-work/,"Meta to cut 10,000 jobs in second round of layoffs",Katie Paul,2023-03-14 23:17:00+00:00,,"March 14 (Reuters) - Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META.O) said on Tuesday it would cut 10,000 jobs this year, making it the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs as the industry braces for a deep economic downturn.
Meta shares jumped 6% on the news. The widely-anticipated job cuts are part of a restructuring that will see the company scrap hiring plans for 5,000 openings, kill off lower-priority projects and ""flatten"" layers of middle management.
They followed the company's first mass layoff in the fall, which eliminated more than 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce at the time, after a hiring spree that doubled the employee count it had as of 2020.
Worries of an economic downturn due to rising interest rates have sparked a series of mass job cuts across corporate America in recent months. Tech companies have led the way, shedding more than 290,000 workers since the start of 2022, according to tracking site Layoffs.fyi.

Meta's purge of employees has been one of the sector's most pronounced. On top of inflation woes, the company is also facing down unique threats to its core digital ads business while spending handsomely on Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's plans to build a futuristic metaverse.
In a message to staff on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said most of the new cuts would be announced in the next two months, though in some cases they would continue through the end of the year.
""For most of our history, we saw rapid revenue growth year after year and had the resources to invest in many new products. But last year was a humbling wake-up call,"" Zuckerberg wrote.
""I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.""
Zuckerberg said he planned to further reduce the size of the recruiting team, which was already hard-hit in the fall layoffs. Restructurings in the tech group would be announced in late April and cuts to business groups would come in May.
Meta also will remove multiple layers of management and ask many managers to become individual contributors, while eliminating non-engineering roles, automating more functions and at least partially reversing a commitment to ""remote-first"" work that Zuckerberg made amid COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.

The first of the latest wave of cuts appeared to have started even before Zuckerberg's announcement. On Friday, Meta said it was exploring ""strategic alternatives"" for Kustomer, a customer service company it acquired last year.
It also disbanded its skunkworks New Product Experimentation team and reassigned leader Ime Archibong to work on product for Messenger, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Both changes were initially reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Investors have grown wary of Zuckerberg's prolific spending as revenue growth from Meta's main businesses petered out amid high inflation and a digital ads pullback from the pandemic e-commerce boom.
The company also has struggled with Apple-led (AAPL.O) privacy changes and competition for young users from short video app TikTok.
At the same time, Meta has been pouring billions of dollars into its metaverse-oriented Reality Labs unit, which lost $13.7 billion in 2022, and investing in infrastructure to support its artificial intelligence usage.
Wall Street has been rewarding Meta steadily since its November restructuring, after its share price fell more than 70% earlier in 2022. The stock received another boost in February when Zuckerberg dubbed 2023 the ""Year of Efficiency,"" with new cost controls and a $40-billion share buyback.
The latest downsizing indicates ""how desperate the company is to get costs under control as its revenues have fallen amid declining marketing budgets,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter.
""Virtual reality is an expensive business to be in, so while (Meta) maps out a path through an uncertain landscape, it needs to find efficiencies elsewhere,"" she added.
In his memo, Zuckerberg made scant mention of virtual reality and instead emphasized the company's focus on AI, saying Meta's single largest investment was in ""advancing AI and building it into every one of our products.""
Meta has teased AI-powered ""creative aids"" that can generate images, videos and text but has yet to offer any such products on its apps, even as peers have launched dueling generative AI chatbots and productivity tools in recent months.
With the latest cuts, Meta expects expenses in 2023 to come in between $86 billion and $92 billion, lower than the $89 billion to $95 billion forecast previously.

China will ""help foreign companies seize the opportunity to deepen their presence in China,"" Shu Jueting, a commerce ministry spokesperson, told reporters.
Shu told reporters that China will also ""steadily expand institutional openness.""
A day earlier, China restored the issuance of all categories of visas to foreigners in a move that was largely welcomed by foreign business groups in the country.

Asian Markets,/markets/asia/,Japan exports up for 2 straight yrs but global headwinds point to soft outlook,Tetsushi Kajimoto,2023-03-16 03:37:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VFF7MSBACBORBPWA2ADNPBG7WU.jpg,"TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Japan posted two straight years of export gains, led by solid U.S.-bound shipments of cars, although expectations of a strong recovery in demand are quickly fading amid global monetary tightening and worries about banks worldwide.
The world's third-biggest economy has struggled to make a solid post-COVID recovery, undermined by lacklustre household consumption and a global slowdown. Slowing shipments to China have also shattered policymakers' hopes for a quick rebound from the pandemic doldrums.
The trade data by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) showed on Thursday Japan's exports grew 6.5% year-on-year in February, undershooting a 7.1% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a 3.5% rise in the previous month.
Imports rose 8.3%, versus the median estimate for a 12.2% increase, resulting in a trade deficit of 897.7 billion yen ($6.75 billion).
It marked the biggest trade shortfall for the month of February.

The Japanese economy narrowly averted a recession in the final months of 2022, as consumption remained weak while exports were hampered by slowdown in global growth.
Monetary tightening across the world, supply chain constraints and the Ukraine war have undercut Japan's recovery.
In a glimmer of hope for a potential pick-up in private demand, the leading gauge of business investment showed a strong reading on Thursday.
Core machinery orders rose 9.5% in January from a month earlier, the biggest monthly hike in more than two years.
Orders from service-sector companies jumped 19.5% to a level last seen in November 2019, as they ramped up investments for post-pandemic demand.
However, orders from manufacturing companies fell 2.6% dragged down by IT and auto firms amid weak global economy and semiconductor needs.

Carbon Markets,/markets/carbon/,Bid in for $500 mln U.S. climate grant for direct air carbon capture,Valerie Volcovici,2023-03-15 19:13:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - Two companies developing technology to suck carbon out of the air, Switzerland's Climeworks and California's Heirloom, have teamed with non-profit firm Battelle to bid for a $500 million U.S. grant to commercialize the climate-friendly technology.
The U.S. Department of Energy launched a five-year program last year to spend $3.5 billion to build four regional Direct Air Capture, or DAC, hubs to kickstart commercialization of technology to capture carbon dioxide from the air and store it permanently.
Scientists view direct air carbon capture as vital to limiting global warming, but the technology is nascent.
Terms of the $500 million grant require a hub to scale up to sequestering one million tonnes a years of carbon dioxide. Applications for an initial set of grants closed this week.
The Department of Energy declined to say how many applications it had received.
Unprecedented federal investment, private sector activity and endorsement by scientists of the need for carbon removal to meet global climate goals has created a ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" to deploy the technology, Battelle's energy and resilience manager, Shawn Bennett, told Reuters.
View 2 more stories 
Battelle has a history of working with carbon capture technology and managing centers and labs for the government.
Geologic storage company Gulf Coast Sequestration would permanently store captured carbon underground at a southwestern Louisiana site if the hub is selected, but it is not part of the group seeking the grant.
Climeworks currently has the largest operational DAC project, in Iceland, which is sucking up around 4,000 tonnes per year of carbon dioxide (CO2), a drop in the bucket compared to the 36.8 billion tonnes of global energy-related CO2 emissions estimated by the International Energy Agency for 2022.
Heirloom has a small-scale demonstration project in California.
Other projects, which may be seeking government support, also aim to remove carbon at a large scale.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N) last year outlined plans to spend $1.1 billion on a facility in the Texas Permian basin oil field that aims to start up in 2024.
A California-based company also announced plans last year to launch in Wyoming what it says could be the first large-scale DAC project to capture and store 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year by 2030.
The Department of Energy said by mid-century, carbon removal will need to be deployed at the gigaton, or billion-tonne, scale, meaning it would need to be able to sequester the equivalent of emissions from approximately 250 million vehicles driven in one year.

Spot gold rose 0.3% to $1,924.15 per ounce by 1122 GMT, after jumping to its highest since early Feb at $1,937.28 on Wednesday. U.S. gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,928.70.

Commodities,/markets/commodities/,Column: China's uneven economic recovery to be mirrored in commodity imports,Clyde Russell,2023-03-16 13:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/I4WYI3YNR5KTNEFIRZWCPEUCGY.jpg,"LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 16 (Reuters) - China's economic recovery appears to be on track, but is unevenly spread across sectors, which is likely to result in a similar pattern for its imports of major commodities.
A slew of data from the world's second-biggest economy showed some encouraging signs of a recovery in industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment.
Industrial output rose 2.4% in the first two months of 2023 from the same period last year, retail sales jumped 3.5%, while fixed-asset investment gained 5.5%.
China publishes combined January and February data to smooth out distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in January this year but was in February in 2022.
Also key for commodity demand was the 9.0% jump in infrastructure investment in the first two months, but this was somewhat offset by a 5.7% drop in property investment, although this was an improvement on the decline of 10% for 2022 as a whole.

Infrastructure and property construction are key drivers of demand for copper and steel, and its raw materials of iron ore and coking coal.
The rising spending on infrastructure and signs of less weakness in property investment are already showing up in China's iron ore imports.
China takes about 70% of global seaborne iron ore volumes and its imports for March are estimated by Refinitiv at around 94 million tonnes, while commodity analysts Kpler have a higher forecast of 99.96 million.
This would put daily imports in a range between 3.03 million and 3.22 million tonnes, slightly below the official customs figure of 3.29 million for the first two months of 2023.
However, it's worth noting that the January-February outcome was the strongest on a daily basis since September last year.
China's steel output also rose in the first two months of 2023, gaining 5.6% from the same period last year to reach 168.7 million tonnes.
Iron ore imports and steel output tend to be leading indicators of commodity demand in China, the world's largest importer of natural resources, as mills tend to ramp up production ahead of anticipated demand for building and manufacturing.
The iron ore imports for the first quarter and the steel output data for the January-February period do suggest increasing activity, but they aren't so strong as to point to a huge rebound in China's economy.
Rather, the data seems to be broadly supportive of a solid start to achieving China's stated economic growth target of 5% for 2023.
The modest recovery in China's growth has yet to show up in some other major commodities, especially crude oil, which tends to be a lagging indicator given it takes several months from when cargoes are purchased to when they are delivered and processed by refineries.
Crude oil imports in the first two months of the year were 1.25% lower at 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) than the same period in 2022, according to customs data.
March imports are expected at around 11.18 million bpd, according to Refinitiv Oil Research, which represents some acceleration from the official numbers, but hardly the massive lift in demand being forecast for the whole of 2023 by a range of analysts and organisations, including the International Energy Agency and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
It's likely that China's crude imports will accelerate from the second quarter onwards as the country continues to reopen after abandoning its strict zero-COVID policy.
But there are other factors to consider, such as whether Beijing will continue to provide refiners with quotas to export refined products, as these tend to boost crude imports to provide the feedstock for the refined fuel exports.
Price is also an important driver of China's energy imports, with high prices tending to lead to lower crude imports as refiners use up some of the large inventories they have accumulated in recent years.
The impact of price can be seen in imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which dropped sharply in 2022 amid record high spot prices for the super-chilled fuel.
However, lower prices this year have tempted buyers back into the market, and China is on track to import 5.39 million tonnes of LNG in March, according to data compiled by commodity analysts Kpler.
This would be up from February's 4.96 million tonnes and also above the 4.77 million from March last year.

Currencies,/markets/currencies/,Euro gives back gains after ECB's interest rate decision,Alun John,2023-03-16 13:57:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/3GHWF25CLRNSNK36B623BNCAZY.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The euro gave back earlier small gains on Thursday after the European Central Bank stuck to its plan for a half-percentage-point interest rate increase despite recent market volatility, but said the future rate path would depend on incoming data.
The ECB has been raising rates at its fastest pace on record to curb high inflation, but a rout in global markets since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States last week had threatened to upend those plans at the last moment.
The euro fell as much as 0.25% after the ECB's decision, having traded around 0.2% higher before the decision. It was last flat on the day at $1.05775
Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, said the promised 50-basis-point rate hike ""sends a strong message on inflation, but the statement is peppered with reference to market tensions. This means the ECB will be data-dependent.""
Currency markets, like markets more broadly, were calmer on Thursday after Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) said it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence.

The bank's shares plunged as much as 30% on Wednesday.
That stability also helped the Swiss franc to strengthen, and the dollar at one point fell more than 1% against the franc , to 0.9232, reversing some of its 2.15% surge on Wednesday - the largest daily gain since 2015.
""We already saw a recovery since the SNB stepped in to offer its reassurances. I presume that we'll continue to hear more reassurances about the safety of the banking system and I would expect that would come through with the ECB,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.
Elsewhere, the safe-haven Japanese yen remained in favour even as markets calmed a little.
The dollar was last down 1.17% against the yen at 131.92, around a 4% slide from the nearly three-month high that the U.S. currency hit on March 8 before markets entered their tailspin.
Sterling was steady at $1.2046, and the dollar index, which tracks the unit against six main peers, was down 0.1% at 104.5 .

The euro fell as much as 0.25% after the ECB's decision, having traded around 0.2% higher before the decision. It was last flat on the day at $1.05775
Antoine Bouvet, senior rates strategist at ING, said the promised 50-basis-point rate hike ""sends a strong message on inflation, but the statement is peppered with reference to market tensions. This means the ECB will be data-dependent.""
Currency markets, like markets more broadly, were calmer on Thursday after Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) said it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence.

The bank's shares plunged as much as 30% on Wednesday.
That stability also helped the Swiss franc to strengthen, and the dollar at one point fell more than 1% against the franc , to 0.9232, reversing some of its 2.15% surge on Wednesday - the largest daily gain since 2015.
""We already saw a recovery since the SNB stepped in to offer its reassurances. I presume that we'll continue to hear more reassurances about the safety of the banking system and I would expect that would come through with the ECB,"" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.
Elsewhere, the safe-haven Japanese yen remained in favour even as markets calmed a little.
The dollar was last down 1.17% against the yen at 131.92, around a 4% slide from the nearly three-month high that the U.S. currency hit on March 8 before markets entered their tailspin.
Sterling was steady at $1.2046, and the dollar index, which tracks the unit against six main peers, was down 0.1% at 104.5 .

Currencies,/markets/currencies/,India cbank may let rupee weaken past 83/USD amid global banking turmoil - analysts,Nimesh Vora,2023-03-16 12:54:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/JBY37H3GENJKRM56UH5ZOKGNSQ.jpg,"MUMBAI, March 16 (Reuters) - The ongoing turbulence in the United States and European banking sector may make the Reserve Bank of India more willing to let the rupee weaken below a key psychological level, analysts said on Thursday.
The rupee declined to 82.80 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday, its lowest in about two weeks.
The RBI has, on multiple occasions, intervened to protect the rupee from 83 levels over the last several weeks, holding the currency in a tight band.  read more 
""Its clear to us that the RBI will not defend the rupee at 83 or any other level if there is a severe, broad episode of risk off,"" the head of trading at a private sector bank said.
""Against a barrage of dollar outflows and speculation that will follow if the (U.S. and European) banking situation worsens, the RBI will definitely be more judicious on how it expends the reserves.""
Concerns about the stability of banks are spreading outside of the United States, pushing up the demand for the safe-haven dollar. Following the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank last week, Swiss National Bank had to come to the rescue of Credit Suisse.

A significant and persistent deterioration in risk appetite on account of the banking worries will have an impact on the RBI's intervention strategy.
""The RBI will reevaluate its stance with the objective of managing volatility in USD/INR and keeping in mind the global situation and the forex reserves,"" said Bhaskar Panda, head of overseas treasury at HDFC Bank.
India's foreign exchange reserves stood at $562.4 billion as on March 3. The reserves had dipped to near $525 billion in October from a record high of $642 billion.
The markets will be ""volatile and news-driven,"" a trader at a public sector bank said, adding that if investors turn risk-off in case of more bank failures the central bank may have to let go of the 83 levels.
If the crisis persists, the RBI's main focus will be on seeing how the volatility expectations on the rupee ""remain anchored,"" the private bank head said.
From the risk-reward perspective, it makes sense for Indian importers not to rely on RBI support in the current environment, the banker added.

Deals,/markets/deals/,Pfizer looks past COVID with $43 bln deal for cancer drug maker Seagen,Manas Mishra,2023-03-13 16:32:00+00:00,,"March 13 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Monday struck a $43 billion deal to acquire Seagen Inc (SGEN.O) and its targeted cancer therapies as it braces for a steep fall in COVID-19 sales and generic competition for some top-selling drugs.
Seagen marks Pfizer's largest purchase in a string of recent acquisitions utilizing a once-in-a-lifetime cash windfall from its COVID-19 vaccine and treatment. It will add four approved cancer therapies with combined sales of nearly $2 billion in 2022.
Washington-based Seagen is a pioneer of antibody-drug conjugates, which work like ""guided missiles"" designed to destroy cancer while sparing healthy cells.
Seagen's shares were trading up more than 16% at $200.93 on Monday, well below Pfizer's offer price of $229, signaling investor concern over a possible prolonged antitrust review. Pfizer shares were nearly 3% higher.
Pfizer's bid represents a 32.7% premium to Seagen's closing price on Friday.

""The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) clearance is sort of the open question at this point with regards to the deal,"" said Needham & Co analyst Ami Fadia, pointing to an overlap in bladder cancer treatments as an area the FTC could look into.
However, Fadia said there was less than a 50% chance of the FTC challenging the deal in court.
Pfizer, on a conference call to discuss the planned acquisition, acknowledged that antitrust regulators are likely to closely review the deal due to its size, but said the companies expect to be able to complete the transaction in late 2023 or early 2024.
Adding Seagen helps Pfizer move into an area ""that is more protected from a regulatory and patent perspective, and market dynamics,"" Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on the call.
Seagen is set to benefit from out-of-pocket healthcare spending caps for older Americans under President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bourla said, meaning more patients could gain access to the company's expensive treatments.
A focus on complex biotech medicines also provides a longer exclusivity on the market versus pills before becoming subject to government price limits under the IRA, he said. The U.S. Medicare program will be allowed to negotiate drug prices for the first time, with new prices for the initial 10 drugs selected starting in 2026.
Seagen's complicated drugs also make it more difficult for rivals to develop less expensive biosimilar versions, which could lengthen their profitability.
The latest deal comes as Pfizer seeks to mitigate an anticipated $17 billion hit to revenue by 2030 from patent expirations for top drugs, and a decline in demand for its COVID products.
Pfizer's COVID vaccine, which it shares with BioNTech (22UAy.DE), and oral antiviral treatment Paxlovid have brought in sales of more $90 billion through 2022.
The New York-based drugmaker said the Seagen deal and other recent acquisitions could generate more than $20 billion in combined sales in 2030.
Pfizer's recent deals include its purchase of Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion, migraine headache drug maker Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding for $11.6 billion and a $6.7 billion buyout of drug developer Arena Pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer's oncology portfolio already boasts 24 approved therapies. The Seagen purchase would add Adcetris for lymphoma, Padcev for bladder cancers, Tivdak for cervical cancer and breast cancer treatment Tukysa.
Pfizer rival Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Seagen were in advanced deal talks last year before they collapsed, according to reports.

Deals,/markets/deals/,Exclusive: Malaysia's Petronas offers $460 mln for stake in India's NTPC's green arm - sources,Sarita Chaganti Singh,2023-03-16 11:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2QRO7C3XBFPHDIS2NPTTWUNGWM.jpg,"NEW DELHI, March 16 (Reuters) - Malaysia's Petronas [RIC:RIC:PETR.UL] has offered 38 billion rupees ($460 million) to buy a 20% stake in the green energy arm of India's largest power producer, NTPC, in the first deal of its kind by a state-run firm, three sources told Reuters.
The offer price was higher than the 30 billion rupees NTPC (NTPC.NS) had been expecting when it asked for expressions of interest in NTPC Green Energy (NGEL) last year and was 78% above the second-highest bidder. It values the NGEL at $2.3 billion.
NTPC and Petronas did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be named as the deal is still being finalised.
The deal was the first time an Indian state-run company has offered a stake in a renewable energy arm and comes as the country's renewables sector is attracting increasing foreign investment.
Renewables are among the country's top five industries for overseas funds this fiscal year, taking a 5% share of all inflows from April to September 2022 against 3.3% in the same period a year earlier, data from India's commerce ministry showed.

Petronas outbid other local firms for the stake with an offer of 27.52 rupees per share, one government official, an industry source and a banker said. The second-highest bidder, REC Ltd (RECM.NS), offered 15.47 rupees per share, while Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL) (IGAS.NS) placed a bid of 6.67 rupees per share, the banker said.
REC and IGL were also not immediately available for comment.
NTPC plans to use the proceeds from the sale to expand its non-fossil businesses. The company has earmarked investments of more than $30 billion in the next 10 years to raise the share of non-fossil energy in its portfolio to 45% from the present 9.41%.
The company has committed to adding 60 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2032 on a total group capacity of 130 gigawatts by that date.
NGEL will drive the parent company's non-fossil businesses.
India has set a goal to become net-zero by 2070 and has committed to have 50% of its installed electric power capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy by 2030.
The country targets 500 gigawatts of renewable energy generation by 2030. Renewable energy sources including wind, hydro and biomass, constitute 30% of the country's present installed capacity of 412 gigawatts.
Earlier this month, the CEO of Petronas' clean energy arm told Reuters that India and Australia are its key markets for growth and it expects to tap more financing to meet its ambitious targets.
The Petronas transaction needs to be approved by the federal government.

Deals,/markets/deals/,Canada's Couche-Tard to buy some TotalEnergies stations in $3.3 bln deal,Dominique Vidalon,2023-03-16 10:02:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2CLWUHD2SNNEXEZ4ILP7L7Q44U.jpg,"PARIS, March 16 (Reuters) - French oil major TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) is selling some of its European petrol stations to Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard for $3.3 billion as part of plans to turn them into food and services hubs, the companies said on Thursday.
Couche-Tard (ATD.TO) has been seeking to expand in Europe since its bid for French grocer Carrefour (CARR.PA) failed in 2021 due to opposition from the French government.
The companies said that under the deal the Canadian firm would buy all of TotalEnergies' service stations in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as purchasing a 60% stake in the French company's stations in Belgium and Luxembourg.
The company will pay the purchase price of 3.1 billion euros ($3.29 billion) in cash.
""Service stations must expand from just selling fuel to become fully-fledged service hubs,"" TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a joint statement.
View 2 more stories 
TotalEnergies said it would retain control of activities related to off-station electric vehicle charging (charging hubs), hydrogen retail and wholesale fuel business, as well as the AS 24 service station network for trucks.
The transaction will help TotalEnergies meet a target of reducing its petroleum product sales by 30% by 2030 so that its fuel sales and refining throughput do not exceed its oil production, the company said.
Since 2015, TotalEnergies has divested its service station networks in Italy, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
Couche-Tard said it plans to fund the deal with available cash along with existing credit facilities and new debt.
Founded in 1980, Couche-Tard has grown from a single store in Quebec to a global network of convenience stores and gas stations mostly through acquisitions.
In January 2021, Couche-Tard's $20 billion approach for Carrefour, Europe's largest food retailer, was rejected by the French government on food security concerns.  read more

The deal will allow T-Mobile to tap a larger share of the pay-as-you-go customer base, whose numbers are expected to swell as credit-challenged people shy away from hefty monthly bills.
It will also provide a boost to T-Mobile's business at a time when promotions from rivals Verizon (T.N) and AT&T (T.N) have driven up its churn rate, which refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a service.
The agreement consists of 39% cash and 61% stock, with the final purchase price set to be decided by Ka'ena's performance during certain periods before and after the closing of the deal that is expected later this year.

The purchase will add slightly to T-Mobile's core adjusted earnings, but is not expected to affect its outlook for the year.
""Over the long term, we'll also benefit from applying the marketing formula Mint has become famous for across more parts of T-Mobile,"" said Mike Sievert, Chief Executive Officer of T-Mobile.
Mint is known for its marketing tactics that often feature part-owner Reynolds. At the onset of the pandemic in 2020, the ""Deadpool"" star left a voicemail for users informing them that the company had given them unlimited free data.
Reynolds' portfolio also includes British soccer club Wrexham and Aviation American Gin, which was sold to Diageo for about $610 million in 2020. The actor, however, maintains ""ongoing ownership interest"" in Aviation Gin.

Shares in Purplebricks rose more than 14% in morning trade on the news.
A local industry publication Estate Agent Today reported on Wednesday, citing sources close to the talks, that Strike was interested in combining the Purplebricks brand with its own fee-free model, but was being stifled by the bidding process.
Strike did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
A non disclosure agreement required as part of the takeover process would prevent Strike from speaking with its investors to back the potential deal, the report said.
Sky News reported earlier this month that Purplebricks founder and former Chief Executive Officer Michael Bruce had been considering floating an offer to regain control over the company, nearly four years after he stepped down from the role.

According to the National Bank of Poland's latest forecasts, inflation will not return to its target range of 1.5-3.5% until the third quarter of 2025, but governor Adam Glapinski has said he hopes it will be possible to cut rates at the end of 2023.
""Today there are not conditions (for rate cuts) until the end of the projection period, so until the end of 2025,"" he told private broadcaster TOK FM.
Inflation in Poland was 18.4% year on year in February, according to statistics office data released on Wednesday, in what most economists expect to be the peak of the current cycle.
Glapinski has said he expects inflation to fall to single digits at the turn of August and September.

However, Kotecki said that inflation did not show signs of weakening and that prospects of it reaching single digits by the end of the year were receding.
""What worries me is that inflation still does not show significant, lasting signs of weakening,"" he said. ""In my opinion we are moving away from the promise made by some Council members that inflation could be single-digit in December.""

The STOXX 600 (.STOXX) was down 0.1% by 1330 GMT, testing a 10-week low, after rising as much as 1.4% in early trading.
The index is on track to lose nearly 4% so far this week, dragged down by bank stocks in the aftermath of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank's collapse last week.
The banks sector index (.SX7P) fell 0.4%, after logging its steepest one-day drop in more than a year in the previous session.
""Inflation is projected to remain too high for too long,"" the ECB monetary policy statement said, raising its key lending rate by 50 basis points to ensure the timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target.
""To back-track (from its 50bps hike projected earlier) now probably risked sending a message that worries over financial stability and contagion from the U.S. bank failures is seen as a serious enough concern,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.

European Markets,/markets/europe/,Hedge funds' Europe stock buying spree unlikely to be maintained -JP Morgan,Nell Mackenzie,2023-03-09 13:13:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HQCB2B4K7RPURFRVYPHIB2W5G4.jpg,"LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Hedge funds' bullish equity positioning in Europe is in line with some of the highest levels of the past five years but the appetite for stocks may fade amid rising interest rates and dour signals from bond markets, JP Morgan said in a note to clients on Thursday.
European share prices may have been supported since November by hedge funds covering their short positions, essentially a bet that an asset price will weaken, the bank said, noting that there was less buying of UK equity.
The STOXX 600 index, a broad measure of European shares (.STOXX), has risen around 20% from lows hit in October and is holding up even as bond markets sell off in a sign that aggressive rate hikes will weaken economic growth ahead.
Trend funds, or CTAs, which frequently switch their buy and sell positions, have stayed bullish for longer than they usually would in European equities, the note said.
These funds ride the price of an rising or falling stock until it changes direction.

As well as closing bearish bets, some hedge funds have added long positions since February, although the bank questioned whether this trend would continue.
""The potential for cyclicals to keep getting bought as much as they have lately - by hedge funds at least - also seems unlikely,"" JP Morgan said.
Cyclical stocks are those companies that typically make or sell products that do well when the economy flourishes, such as restaurants, airlines, hotel chains and automobiles.
Industrial and transport companies also saw bullish buying, the note said.
Equity funds, multi-strategy funds and computer led and trend trading were among the hedge funds involved in covering short positions and establishing long positions, it said.

Money market pricing has varied greatly this past week as traders have digested a whirlwind of news, from the collapse of two large regional U.S. banks to Swiss regulators having to pledge assistance to Credit Suisse.
After the ECB's decision to go ahead with a 50 basis point hike to tame too-hot inflation despite volatility in financial markets, traders of U.S. rate futures firmed up their bets that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates by 25 basis points next week.
The likelihood of a 25 basis point hike at the March 21-22 meeting was also bolstered on Thursday by an unexpected drop in jobless claims, which pointed to continued labor market strength, and stronger-than-expected housing data.

Benchmark indexes regained some ground in late trade after Bloomberg reported the Swiss government was holding talks on options to stabilize the country's banking giant. The Nasdaq composite closed with slight gains.

""They've tightened at the steepest, most dramatic rate that we've seen since 1980 and so I think this could be the opportunity for them to pause,"" said Cresset Capital CIO, Jack Ablin.
U.S.-listed shares of Credit Suisse hit a record low, after its largest investor said it could not provide more financing to the bank, starting a rout in European lenders and pressuring U.S. banks as well.
The selloff put an early end to Wall Street's lukewarm rebound in yesterday's session.

U.S. Markets,/markets/us/,"After Silicon Valley Bank's shutdown, uninsured depositors face tense wait",Pete Schroeder,2023-03-11 00:43:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/UDTIZKAELFL3HDX6VPGRX32VUI.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Silicon Valley Bank's high level of uninsured deposits helped kick off the run that led to the bank's closing down, and now any of those depositors will need to hold their breath to see if bank regulators can recover enough to make them whole.
Friday’s announcement by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that the bank was closed came with few specifics on what will happen to bank customers who held more than the $250,000 per account that is guaranteed by the government.
In prior large bank failures like IndyMac and Washington Mutual, the FDIC found other firms to take on the assets and keep deposits intact. But failing that, uninsured depositors will be left with a portion of whatever funds the FDIC can raise selling off the bank's assets.
SVB Financial Group's (SIVB.O) Silicon Valley Bank had a relatively high amount of uninsured deposits as it courted tech workers and venture capital firms. The FDIC said on Friday the amount of uninsured deposits at the bank was “undetermined,” likely complicated by the rush of bank customers to remove uninsured funds. But data submitted to the FDIC by the bank at the end of 2022 showed that 89% of its $175 billion in deposits were uninsured.

All insured deposits will be accessible in full no later than Monday morning, but the FDIC said uninsured depositors will get a “receivership certificate,” and that future dividend payments “may be made” to pay off uninsured funds as the bank’s assets are sold. Customers with uninsured deposits were told to call the FDIC.
An SVB spokeswoman referred questions to the FDIC. An FDIC spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.
Regulatory experts say account holders with uninsured funds are not typically individuals. Usually, accounts with such high funds are companies that need cash on hand for payroll and other expenses. But Silicon Valley Bank’s relatively well-off clientele could be the exception, and the push for full repayment was already coming from some corners.
“We must make sure all deposits exceeding the FDIC $250k limit are honored,"" tweeted U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat. ""Banking is about confidence. If depositors lose confidence on the safety of their deposits over 250k then we are in trouble.”
Beyond selling off the assets piecemeal, another possible move by the FDIC would be to find another firm to take on all or a portion of the assets. This move is typically preferred by the regulator as a smoother process that ensures depositors are minimally disrupted and usually kept whole. But that process can be lengthy, leaving uninsured depositors in the dark.
“This will likely be similar to the failure of IndyMac Bank in 2008,"" said Joseph Lynyak, a partner with Dorsey & Whitney who specializes in bank failures. ""The FDIC closed that bank but had not already lined up an assuming bank. It took several weeks to find an investor.”
“The FDIC is likely negotiating a similar arrangement as we speak, with the result that virtually all assets and liabilities of Silicon Valley Bank will be transferred to the assuming bank in a short period of time.”

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"Japan registers two straight years of export growth in February, outlook less rosy",Tetsushi Kajimoto,2023-03-16 04:28:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VFF7MSBACBORBPWA2ADNPBG7WU.jpg,"TOKYO, March 16 (Reuters) - Japan posted two straight years of export gains in February, led by solid U.S.-bound shipments of cars, although expectations of a strong recovery in demand are quickly fading amid global monetary tightening and worries about banks worldwide.
The world's third-biggest economy has struggled to make a solid post-COVID recovery, undermined by lacklustre household consumption and a global slowdown.
Slowing shipments to China, which fell for a third straight month, have also shattered policymakers' hopes for a quick rebound from the pandemic doldrums.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) trade data released on Thursday showed exports grew 6.5% year-on-year in February, driven by U.S.-bound shipments of cars but undershooting a 7.1% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a 3.5% rise in the previous month.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner fell 10.9% year-on-year in February, registering a second straight month of double-digit decline, as demand weakened for cars, auto parts and display-making equipment.

Imports rose 8.3%, versus the median estimate for a 12.2% increase, resulting in a trade deficit of 897.7 billion yen ($6.75 billion). The yen's 13.5% depreciation versus the dollar made the costs of energy imports even higher.
Japan has now posted a trade deficit for 19 straight months.
The Japanese economy narrowly averted a recession in the final months of 2022, as consumption remained weak while exports were hampered by slowdown in global growth.
Monetary tightening across the world, supply chain constraints and the Ukraine war have undercut Japan's recovery.
""Chances are 50-50 that Japan may slide into recession,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
More optimistically, the leading gauge of business investment showed a strong reading, providing a glimmer of hope for a potential pick-up in private demand.
The data released on Thursday showed core machinery orders rose 9.5% in January from a month earlier, the biggest rise in more than two years.
Ramping up investment to meet post-pandemic demand, service sector companies' orders jumped 19.5% to a level last seen in November 2019.
However, orders from manufacturing companies fell 2.6% dragged down by metal, electronics and auto firms due to the weak global economy and reduced demand for semiconductors.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,ECB raises rates as planned despite banking turmoil,Balazs Koranyi,2023-03-16 14:01:00+00:00,,"FRANKFURT, March 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank raised interest rates by 50 basis points on Thursday as promised, ignoring financial market chaos and calls by investors to dial back policy tightening at least until sentiment stabilises.
The ECB has been raising rates at its fastest pace on record to curb inflation, but a rout in global markets since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States last week had threatened to upend those plans at the last moment.
In line with its often-repeated guidance, the central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro lifted its deposit rate to 3%, the highest level since late 2008, as inflation is seen overshooting its 2% target through 2025.
But it offered no commitments for the future, despite previous calls by a long list of policymakers for more big moves in the fight against inflation.
""The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions,"" the ECB said.

On Thursday morning, after days of turmoil in markets, financial investors had seen a 50% chance of a smaller, 25 basis point move by the ECB. They have also dialled down expectations for future moves, forecasting the peak rate at 3.25%, below the 4.1% priced last week.
Euro zone bank shares have been in freefall this week, spooked first by SVB's collapse, then a plunge in the value of Credit Suisse, a lender that has long been dogged by problem.
But the Swiss National Bank threw Credit Suisse a $54 billion lifeline overnight, a big enough show of force to send its shares back up around 20% and lift other bank stocks.
The key worry for the ECB is that monetary policy works via the banking system, and a full blown financial crisis would make its policy ineffective.
That left the ECB in a dilemma, pitting its inflation-fighting mandate against the need to maintain financial stability in the face of overwhelmingly imported turmoil.
Inflation, the bank's primary responsibility, is far higher than in previous crises and the ECB's new projections, published on Thursday, put price growth above its 2% target through 2025, an overriding concern for many ECB governors.
Inflation is seen averaging 5.3% this year, 2.9% in 2024 and 2.1% in 2025, the ECB said, adding that these projections were finalised before the current turmoil.
""The Governing Council is monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area,"" the ECB said.
While systemic banking crises generally morph into deep recessions, the euro zone's financial system is in its best shape in years, with capital, liquidity and profits all at healthy levels.
Some economists also argued that the ECB has plenty of instruments to fight market stress, and so had not needed to sacrifice the rate move to keep financial assets buoyant.
Investor attention now turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde's news conference where she will be quizzed on future policy moves and risk of contagion in the banking sector.
She will attempt to reassure investors about the health of the bloc's banks and say that a raft of ECB liquidity facilities remain available in case of need.
But she is likely to stop short of offering specific measures to help banks, especially since the ECB has just removed a subsidy from a key long-term lending instrument in an attempt to wean lenders off central bank cash.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"UK Budget: Hunt tries to jolt economy with childcare, pension reforms",David Milliken,2023-03-16 08:00:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Finance minister Jeremy Hunt sought on Wednesday to revitalise Britain's stagnating economy with a mix of childcare and pension reforms to tempt people back to work, as well as corporate tax breaks to boost weak business investment.
Saying the world's sixth-biggest economy was now set to avoid a recession this year - even if it will still contract - Hunt extended help for households hit hard by soaring energy bills and froze a tax on vehicle fuel.
""In the face of enormous challenges, I report today on a British economy which is proving the doubters wrong,"" Hunt said, to jeers from the opposition Labour Party which is riding high in opinion polls ahead of an election expected next year.
""In the autumn we took difficult decisions to deliver stability and sound money,"" said Hunt, who was rushed into the Treasury last October to undo the plans for tax cuts that sowed chaos in financial markets during Liz Truss's brief premiership.

""The International Monetary Fund says our approach means the UK economy is on the right track.""
Labour leader Keir Starmer accused Hunt of ""dressing up stagnation as stability"" and said Britain ""is on a path of managed decline.""
After the shocks of Brexit, a heavy COVID-19 hit and double-digit inflation, Britain's is the only Group of Seven economy yet to recover its pre-pandemic size, having previously suffered a decade of near-stagnant income growth.
Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak resisted calls from some lawmakers in their Conservative Party for big tax cuts now to ease the heaviest tax burden on the economy since World War Two.
But they found money to extend household energy subsidies by three months and freeze fuel duty for another year.
Despite that help, and lower inflation than previously expected, living standards remain on track for a record fall over the two years to the end of March 2024.
In a bid to speed up growth, Hunt expanded free childcare to children under two in England as a way to get more parents of young children into work. Campaigners said the 4 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) of annual funding would not meet demand.
Other measures to boost the size of the workforce included the end of penalties for people breaking thresholds on pension contributions, an attempt to keep more older people in their jobs, and welfare changes to encourage disabled people to work.
Independent forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said it was hard to judge the impact of Hunt's attempts to get more workers into the jobs market and it warned that the share of people in work or looking for it was set to hit a 23-year low next year before rising.
Hunt also announced a new three-year incentive for business investment that will allow companies to offset 100% of their capital expenditure against profits, although that represented a scaling-back of tax breaks under a previous scheme.
The OBR said the change would not cushion all the pain for companies, as a leap in the corporation tax rate next month will represent the heaviest burden on businesses since the levy was introduced in 1965.
Paul Johnson, director of the non-partisan Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the incentives would cause more volatility for businesses.

""Today's announcement is just the latest in a long line of changes and temporary tweaks,"" Johnson said. ""There's no stability, no certainty, and no sense of a wider plan.""
Other budget measures included more investment in nuclear power and a new training programme for workers aged over 50.
Hunt said the government would add 11 billion pounds to the defence budget - which has been stretched by Britain's support for Ukraine in its war with Russia - over the next five years.
A new set of economic forecasts showed gross domestic product was set to shrink by 0.2% in 2023 rather than contract by 1.4% as projected by the OBR in November.
Since then, energy costs - which soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine - have come down and there have been signs of a recovery in some economic data.
""Today the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that because of changing international factors and the measures I take, the UK will not now enter a technical recession this year,"" Hunt said.
The OBR forecast economic output would grow by 1.8% in 2024 and by 2.5% in 2025, he said, compared with its previous forecasts for growth of 1.3% and 2.6% respectively.
It cut its forecast for inflation this year to 6.1% from 7.4% in November - and said it would remain under 1% for the following three years.
Many economists have said Hunt probably wants to hold back some fiscal firepower for closer to the next national election.
But Wednesday's forecasts showed the limits going forward.
Hunt's target to get Britain's public debt - currently standing at about 2.5 trillion pounds - falling as a share of GDP in five years' time was on course to be met with a buffer of just 6.5 billion pounds.
The OBR said that was the narrowest margin for any finance minister since George Osborne set up the fiscal watchdog in 2010.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"Boom, bust or a bit of both: US, global economies are a confounding mix",Howard Schneider,2023-02-27 06:23:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Dana Peterson, the chief economist at the Conference Board, sees a clear conclusion in the sharp decline of the U.S. business group's Leading Economic Index: If recession isn't already taking hold in the United States, then it will soon.
Tell that to Matt Malone, the chief executive officer of Groundworks, and the response is anything but recessionary - with his residential foundation and water management company still booking strong sales, pressing to fill several hundred open jobs, and seeing consumers ready to spend.
""We've been talking about impending recession for several quarters now,"" said Malone, whose Virginia Beach-based company has a national footprint. ""There's a lot of confusion and mixed signals as to what's going on with the consumer ... At the end of the day, we have not seen it affect our business yet.""
Such is the mystery of the U.S. economy, and increasingly the global one as well, three years after the onset of a devastating pandemic, a year and a half into a still-developing inflation surge, and many months into predictions of recessions that continue to miss the mark.
View 2 more stories 
Major central banks have jacked up interest rates at a pace many policymakers and economists thought would prove crushing, perhaps taming inflation but at a high cost. Inflation has slowed a bit, but not so fast or so far that any central banker feels the war is won, and recent data have shown the progress to be slowing.
Demand for goods and services has fallen in sectors like housing and technology that are both highly sensitive to interest rates and were big pandemic winners perhaps due for a trim; but economy-wide, many of the recent surprises have been to the upside as consumers keep finding the means to spend.
The job market?
Businesses like Malone's don't seem to have gotten the memo. The U.S. unemployment rate, at 3.4%, is the lowest it has been since 1969. At this point, Fed officials are less concerned about recession than of trends like labor hoarding that may keep available workers scarce and prevent the modest rise in unemployment many of them feel is needed for inflation to fall.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said in a CNBC interview on Friday that she felt the economy would grow ""well below trend"" this year, but grow nonetheless.
While some sectors are slowing, ""coming into this year there was a little bit more underlying strength than forecasters thought,"" Mester said, while businesses ""have spent so much effort to hire people they are going to do everything they can to keep people on staff, so after we get beyond this slowdown they will have the staff they need.""
Globally, similar dynamics have developed as seemingly inevitable recessions in the euro zone and the United Kingdom have given way to modest ongoing growth.
Unusually warm weather and lower energy prices have helped. So has unexpectedly strong consumer spending and, for the world outlook, the reopening of China's economy from strict COVID lockdowns.
It is, Peterson acknowledged, shaping up as a weird situation. Even if a U.S. recession takes place, she said it could well be short and shallow, with companies retaining hard-to-find workers and only modest cutbacks in household and business spending.
""Businesses are telling us that they are continuing to hire, or not looking to shrink their labor force,"" Peterson said. She added, however, that ultimately ""the key is the consumer.""
""How much are consumers willing to spend? Out of their own income, their wealth ... their credit cards? Maybe we are approaching the point where consumers are tapped out.""
There are warnings on that front beyond the Conference Board's key U.S. index, which has been flashing a recession warning for about a year now.
In the bond market, yields on shorter-term government debt are above those for longer-term securities, a classic recession signal but one Fed officials discount as distorted by inflation.
On a recent earnings call, Walmart Inc (WMT.N) executives noted strong sales growth but signs of economically weakened households: Higher-income consumers bargain shopping to beat inflation, for example, or lagging purchases for discretionary goods.
If, however, consumers continue consuming, hiring bosses keep hiring, and the economy keeps expanding, the dilemma for the Fed and other major central banks is whether inflation can still slow in such an environment.
It's an iffy proposition. Indeed, an Atlanta Fed model currently sees first-quarter U.S. GDP growth, for one, at a robust 2.5%.
The situation has snapped financial markets into their closest alignment with the Fed's outlook since the U.S. central bank began shifting its monetary policy stance in late 2021 and started raising interest rates last March.
Markets have long been skeptical of the Fed's resolve, but what finally seems to have synched them with the U.S. central bank has been data showing the economy was not cracking easily, nor was inflation slowing easily. That poured cold water on the idea that the Fed would ""pivot"" on a dime to lower rates.
Benson Durham, head of global asset allocation at Piper Sandler, said his analysis suggests the recent rise in bond yields that more closely aligned markets with the Fed may not be such good news because it seems to have been driven by expectations for higher inflation.
""Government bond yields are up"" since the last Fed policy meeting, Durham wrote. ""But to conclude that financial conditions are thereby tighter, and that the Fed has less work to do now, would be hasty ... The Fed may now punch harder.""
The release in the coming weeks of employment and inflation data for February will be important in determining whether that is about to happen as Fed policymakers prepare for a March 21-22 meeting, which will include a decision on rates and updated projections for the policy rate and economic outlook.
U.S. consumption and inflation data released on Friday would appear to argue for Fed policymakers to raise their estimated stopping point for the policy rate above December's forecast of 5.1%. Consumer spending rose by the most in nearly two years in January; inflation-tracking indexes that form the basis for Fed policy accelerated that month; and revisions to late-2022 figures showed less progress had been made in beating back inflation than previously thought.
Some argue, however, that the developing market outlook for stickier inflation and higher interest rates may just be the flip side of an economy that keeps surprising in its strength, and which Fed policymakers still feel they can guide to lower inflation levels without a collapse.
""Markets overpriced a recession in the second half of 2022 and overpriced a recession in the first half of 2023,"" St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told CNBC last week. ""It kind of seems the U.S. economy might be more resilient than markets thought six or eight weeks ago.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,ECB pushes through 50 bps rate hike despite market turmoil,Reuters,2023-03-16 13:23:00+00:00,,"FRANKFURT, March 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank pushed through another big increase in interest rates on Thursday, sticking to its inflation fight despite turmoil in financial markets that has raised fears about a global banking crisis.
The ECB raised its three policy rates by 50 basis points in its sixth consecutive rate hike and said future moves will depend on incoming data.
""The elevated level of uncertainty reinforces the importance of a data-dependent approach to the Governing Council’s policy rate decisions, which will be determined by its assessment of the inflation outlook,"" the ECB said.
Thursday's decision increases the rate the ECB pays on bank deposits, which is the benchmark for borrowing costs in the euro zone, to 3.0% from 2.5%.
The central bank for the 20 countries that share the euro has been locked in a fight to bring inflation in the currency bloc back to its 2% target, from 8.5% last month.
But investors had begun to doubt the ECB's resolve to raise rates again this week as a selloff in the banking sector grew to enmesh Switzerland's Credit Suisse, a large lender on the euro zone's doorstep.

""The Governing Council is monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability,"" the ECB said.
It added recent ""tensions imply additional uncertainty around the baseline assessments of inflation and growth"".
Some calm returned to financial markets on Thursday after the Swiss central bank threw Credit Suisse a $54 billion lifeline overnight.
ECB President Christine Lagarde will be certain to face questions about the turmoil and the euro zone banking sector at a news conference starting at 1345 GMT.
After Thursday's hike, the rate on the ECB's little used weekly cash auctions will rise to 3.5% while overnight loans from the central bank will now cost 3.75%.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"U.S. single-family housing starts, building permits rebound in February",Reuters,2023-03-16 13:13:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/74A2EXJ4ANOAVE25ZJPEYDWE5M.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding and permits for future construction rebounded in February, offering hope that the housing market was probably stabilizing after being hammered by higher mortgage rates.
Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, increased 1.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 830,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for January was revised down to show single-family homebuilding falling to a rate of 821,000 units instead of the previously reported 841,000 unit-pace.
Single-family homebuilding increased in the Northeast and West, but tumbled in the densely populated South as well as the Midwest. Single-family housing starts dropped 31.6% on a year-on-year basis in February.
The housing market has been choked by the Federal Reserve's most aggressive interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s to tame inflation. But the worst of the housing market downturn could be over. A survey on Wednesday showed the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index increased for a third straight month in March, though homebuilder sentiment remains depressed.

Mortgage rates, which had resumed their upward trend, could start falling as U.S. Treasury yields have declined sharply after the recent collapse of two regional banks sparked fears of contagion in the banking sector. Some economists believe financial market instability could make it harder for the Fed to continue raising rates next week.
Starts for housing projects with five units or more shot up 24.1% to a rate of 608,000 units, the highest level since last April. Multi-family housing construction remains underpinned by demand for rental accommodation.
With both single- and multi-family homebuilding rising, overall housing starts surged 9.8% to a rate of 1.450 million units last month, the highest level since September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a rate of 1.310 million units in February. Starts dropped 18.4% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Single-family building permits increased 7.6% to a rate of 777,000 units. They had declined for 11 straight months.
Permits for housing projects with five units or more jumped 24.3% to a rate of 700,000 units. Overall, building permits vaulted 13.8% to a rate of 1.524 million units.
The number of houses approved for construction that are yet to be started was unchanged at 294,000 units.
The single-family homebuilding backlog fell 3.0% to 130,000 units, but the completions rate for this segment increased 1.0% to a rate of 1.037 million units. The inventory of single-family housing under construction fell 1.7% to a rate of 734,000 units.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Analysis: Investors brace for hard landing as banking woes stoke recession fears,David Randall,2023-03-16 07:44:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Fears of a recession are growing on Wall Street, as stress in the banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and worries over the fate of Credit Suisse darken the outlook for the economy and markets.
Just weeks ago, analysts and investors were debating whether the U.S. economy would go into recession anytime soon - an outcome dubbed the “no-landing” scenario that projected resilient growth and sticky inflation.
That view has been shaken in the past week. Though recent U.S. data showed strength in key areas such as employment and consumer prices, some investors worry the threat of more ructions in the banking sector on the heels of the Federal Reserve's most aggressive tightening cycle in decades is more than the economy can bear.
“The no landing scenario has quickly evaporated,” said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Asset Management. “Something is breaking right now and we think a recession has potentially been pulled forward.”

Worries over financial stability spread to Europe on Wednesday, after embattled lender Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) was caught up in a crisis of confidence sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week, hammering its shares.
The S&P 500 fell 0.7% (.SPX), while signs of heightened economic anxiety were apparent in a more than 30-basis point decline in two-year Treasury yields - which closely follow interest rate expectations - and a 5% drop in Brent crude to its lowest level in a year.
Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald and Co noted on Wednesday that the spread between the Fed funds rate and the two-year yield had hit 95 basis points. That level was reached before three out of the last four recessions, they said.
An inversion in the Treasury yield curve, meanwhile, has been flashing a recession signal for months, though market participants have debated whether it would manifest as a mild downturn - often referred to as a soft landing - or a more severe, hard landing.
Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, was one of the early proponents of the no-landing scenario, envisioning a situation where the Fed was unable to quickly cool growth and inflation, forcing policymakers to raise rates further than expected and causing a recession sometime next year.
He has changed that view in light of recent concerns over the banking sector and now believes policymakers are unlikely to raise rates at their March 22 meeting as the economy faces a potentially more imminent downturn.
“When the facts change, my view changes. A financial accident has happened, and we are going from no landing to a hard landing driven by tighter credit conditions,” he wrote in a Wednesday note.
Futures markets late Wednesday afternoon were pricing in a slightly better- than-even chance that policymakers will leave their benchmark lending rate in its current 4.5%-4.75% range at their upcoming meeting on March 21-22. That compares to a nearly 80% chance of a 50-basis point hike futures showed a week ago.
""The central banks have a history of hiking until something breaks and we are seeing companies and business models break,"" said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments.
Jacobsen believes the S&P 500 is likely to fall through its October closing low of 3,577, nearly 8% below its current level of 3,891. That contrasts with his outlook two weeks ago, which saw the index rising to 4,400 by year-end.
He is increasing positions in long-short equity strategies, which he expects to benefit from volatile trading in stocks, as well as Treasuries, a popular destination during times of economic uncertainty.
Some investors believe regulators' quick backstop of Silicon Valley Bank, which included guaranteeing the funds of depositors, will prevent a crisis and allow for a soft landing.
“The high reactivity of US regulators to ensure depositors get their money back has helped put a stop to a potential loss of confidence,” said Paul de La Baume, market strategist at FlowBank. “Recent events also tell us that regulators don’t have the appetite for the economy to be at risk.”
Others are less sanguine. Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS, has not changed his view that the S&P 500 will trade at around 3800 by December, but said the risks of a recession are increasing.
“The odds of a soft landing have gone down and the likelihood of a hard landing has gone up,” he said.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Analysis: Sweden faces recession as housing market troubles take toll on economy,Simon Johnson,2023-03-16 06:00:00+00:00,,"STOCKHOLM, March 15 (Reuters) - For years, Sweden has been warned that its dysfunctional housing market, plagued by under-supply and kept aloft by low rates and generous tax benefits, was a risk to the wider economy.
Now those risks are becoming reality. Households with big mortgages are reining in spending as interest rates rise, and house-builders are pulling the plug on investment, tipping Sweden into recession.
The country is set to be the only EU economy experiencing outright recession this year. The crown is trading at around its weakest level against the euro since the global financial crisis, partly due to housing market worries, making the central bank's job of curbing inflation more difficult.
""It's not that no one saw this coming,"" Riksbank Governor Erik Thedeen said at the end of February. ""The Riksbank has warned about this ... for a long time. And now it is clear that it is a problem.""
After years of ultra-low borrowing costs, the pandemic and the Ukraine war have served up a toxic cocktail of high inflation and rapidly rising interest rates to many countries.
But in Sweden, the structural problems rooted in its housing market are magnifying the effects.
View 2 more stories 
House prices in Sweden have almost quadrupled in the last 20 years, easily outstripping wage growth, boosted by generous mortgage tax relief, almost non-existent real estate taxes and a rental market with limited supply because of tight regulations.
Debt levels are among the highest in the European Union at around 200% of disposable incomes, much of which is mortgage debt. And around 60% of Swedes have floating-rate mortgages, meaning rate increases have an immediate impact on the majority of households.
Banking group Nordea (NDAFI.HE) expects household consumption to fall around 2% in 2023, while the National Board of Housing expects housing starts to fall around 50% in the coming year compared with 2021.
Many home-owners are already struggling with higher mortgage repayments alongside surging food and energy prices - even though the full effects of interest rate rises over the last year have yet to be felt.
Philippa Logan, a single mother of two, bought her 89 square meter (958 square feet) apartment in Ostberga in the south of Stockholm in 2017 and paid off some of the mortgage after getting divorced in 2020.
""However, in the last few months, the interest rate has almost tripled making it almost unaffordable to survive,"" Logan said.
""The stress has been indescribable,"" she said, adding she had been forced to take on extra work to make ends meet.
The central bank expects further rate increases in the coming months. Markets expect borrowing costs to peak at 4%, up from 3% currently.
""Our forecast is for the Riksbank to raise rates to 3.75 as a peak,"" Gustav Helgesson, economist at Nordea said. ""I think at that level we are very near some kind of pain threshold for households.""
The European Commission expects Sweden's gross domestic product to contract by around 1% this year - the only country in the 27-member bloc likely to see negative annual growth.
Nordea expects GDP to contract by around 2%.
House prices are down around 15% since their peak in spring last year, a bigger drop than during the global financial crisis. Some regions have experienced a fall of as much as 40%, the real estate division of insurer Lansforsakringar said.
While Sweden is not alone in seeing big house price falls, its households are almost uniquely sensitive to interest rate hikes because more than half have floating rate mortgages.
In Germany, for example, most borrowers have fixed mortgages and rising rates have largely been shrugged off.
""No, we don't have any fear with the mortgages,"" said Hannah, a teacher in the city of Bochum, in the west of the country, whose joint mortgage with her partner is fixed at 0.9%.
""We have 15 years to pay back and it was all planned in a way that we could pay back even if interest rates rose,"" she said.
In Canada, while debt levels are high, variable rate mortgages only account for about one-third of total outstanding mortgage debt, according to the Bank of Canada.
While some economists predict a mild recession in Canada, the OECD think tank expects the Canadian economy will grow around 1.3% in 2023.
Sweden's housing problems date back decades, but have proven hard to fix.
Plans to ease rent controls have been fiercely opposed by the political left which believes introducing market forces would increase social division by pricing many people out of desirable areas of Sweden's cities.
All the main political parties agree an overhaul of mortgage tax relief is needed, but none are prepared to give their rivals a stick to beat them with when elections come around.
Reintroducing a property tax, abolished in 2008, is seen as another sure-fire vote-loser.
Financial regulators have introduced tougher lending practices and tightened mortgage repayment rules. Sweden's banks are among the most strongly capitalised in Europe - partly as a result of worries about the housing market.
These should prevent falling real estate prices from triggering a financial meltdown as happened in Sweden in the early 1990s.
But Sweden's economy is likely to remain a hostage to imbalances in the housing market while its structural problems go unresolved.
""It's up to the politicians to decide whether they want to deal with these problems and, more than anything, when,"" Nordea's Helgesson said. ""In the current situation, it is very hard to tackle them.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,To hike or not to hike? Fed's next move in question as bank crisis feared,Lindsay Dunsmuir,2023-03-15 23:07:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NM37I5UKFBMPJGNAMSEGTGOQLY.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - With just six days to go before Federal Reserve policymakers sit down in Washington, exactly what decision they'll make on interest rates now and in coming months has become pretty much anyone's guess, and investors and Wall Street economists are doing just that.
Over the past year, Fed leadership has gone out of its way to signal its intentions on interest rate hikes aimed at quashing hot inflation, relying on a steady stream of economic data inputs to guide its actions.
But now Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues find themselves needing to respond in real time to turmoil in the banking system after the collapse of two large regional U.S. banks and Swiss regulators having to pledge assistance to Credit Suisse, developments that are reshaping domestic and international financial conditions on a daily - or even hourly - basis.
In one of the most vivid - and relevant - examples, on Monday the yield on the 2-year Treasury note , among the top traded securities in the world that also stands as a proxy for Fed policy expectations, plummeted by more than half a percentage point, the most since the day after Black Monday in October 1987. It then recovered roughly half that on Tuesday only to drop by another third of a point on Wednesday.

And it is all unfolding during the central bank's premeeting blackout period that prevents officials from offering public clarity on their assessment of the situation, and its effect on monetary policy decisions
It was only last week that Powell signaled the central bank might accelerate its interest-rate-hike campaign in the face of persistent inflation. Traders moved to price in a half-point hike in the benchmark interest rate at the Fed's March 21-22 meeting, from its current 4.5%-4.75% range, and further rate hikes beyond.
Traders now see next week as a tossup between a smaller quarter-point hike and a pause, with rate cuts seen likely in following months as the turbulence at Credit Suisse renewed fears of a banking crisis that could cripple the U.S. economy.
Analysts also sought to make sense of fast-moving events, including Friday's failure of Silicon Valley Bank, the creation over the weekend of an emergency Fed backstop for the banking sector, fresh data showing slow progress in the inflation fight, and a renewed banking stock swoon on Wednesday.
""I think they do indeed hike 25 bps next week,"" said Jefferies' Thomas Simmons. ""They need to keep up the fight on inflation to maintain credibility, and a pause here at these levels isn’t going to stop the bleeding in the markets.""
A pause, he argued, risks undoing the work of the Fed's 4.5 percentage points of rate hikes since last March.
""They’d also risk sending a signal to the market that the macroeconomic impact of these microeconomic phenomena is worse than we think,"" he said.
Former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren took the opposite view.
""Financial crises create demand destruction,"" Rosengren said on Twitter. ""Banks reduce credit availability, consumers hold off large purchases, businesses defer spending. Interest rates should pause until the degree of demand destruction can be evaluated.""
At heart, the uncertainty over the Fed's next move comes down to difficulty knowing how swiftly and deeply the current turmoil in the banking sector will filter through to the real economy.
After all, the Fed's rate hikes are designed to slow the economy, and for months some policymaker have expressed puzzlement over why after such aggressive policy tightening there was so little of that to see beyond the sharply-hit housing sector.
After the bank failures in recent days, ""We’re getting a better sense of who’s suffered due to the Fed’s aggressive tightening,"" JPMorgan's Michael Feroli wrote. Slower growth in lending by mid-size banks will sheer off a half to a percentage point of economic growth overall, he predicted, ""broadly consistent"" with the view that higher interest rates will trigger a U.S. recession that will in turn slow inflation.
But the Fed's work in Feroli's view is not yet done.
A key inflation report earlier this week showed a 6% rise in the consumer price index last month from a year earlier.
""A pause now would send the wrong signal about the seriousness of the Fed’s inflation resolve,"" Feroli said.
The Fed next week will publish new projections for the future path of the U.S. benchmark rate. In December policymakers had seen it topping out at 5.1%, and as recently as last week traders expected it to rise above 5.5%.
Now, they are looking for one more Fed rate hike if that, and then a string of reductions to bring the target range down below 4% by year end.
""The Fed has a very difficult policy decision to make at next week’s meeting,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, which for now still leans towards the Fed raising interest rates by a quarter percentage point. ""It is a very close call... the risk of a full-blown contagion remains, and a lot can happen in the week until the announcement.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Swiss central bank throws financial lifeline to Credit Suisse after shares pummelled,Noele Illien,2023-03-15 21:40:00+00:00,,"March 15 (Reuters) - Swiss regulators pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) in an unprecedented move by a central bank after the flagship Swiss lender's shares tumbled as much as 30% on Wednesday.
In a joint statement, the Swiss financial regulator FINMA and the nation's central bank sought to ease investor fears around Credit Suisse, saying it ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks."" They said the bank could access liquidity from the central bank if needed.
The statement came after a major government and at least one bank put pressure on Switzerland to act, said people familiar with the matter, as the lender became caught up in a crisis of confidence after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last week.
Credit Suisse said it welcomed the statement of support from the Swiss National Bank and FINMA.
Credit Suisse would be the first major global bank to be given such a lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis - though central banks have extended liquidity more generally to banks during times of market stress including the coronavirus pandemic.

SVB's demise, followed by that of Signature Bank two days later, sent global bank stocks on a roller-coaster ride this week, with investors discounting assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden and emergency steps giving banks access to more funding.
By Wednesday, focus had shifted from the United States to Europe, where Credit Suisse led a rout in bank shares after its largest investor said it could not provide more financial assistance because of regulatory constraints.
Hoping to quell concerns, FINMA and the Swiss central bank said there were no indications of a direct risk of contagion for Swiss institutions from U.S. banking market turmoil.
Earlier, Credit Suisse shares led a 7% fall in the European banking index (.SX7P), while five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for the flagship Swiss bank hit a new record high.
The investor exit for the doors prompted fears of a broader threat to the financial system, and two supervisory sources told Reuters that the European Central Bank had contacted banks on its watch to quiz them about their exposures to Credit Suisse.
One source said, however, that they saw Credit Suisse's problems as specific to that bank, rather than being systemic.
""(The) SVB collapse is a firm- and U.S.-specific problem, but now markets have reawakened to global banks’ risks – from interest rate/duration to liquidity and credit risk – and European banks are engulfed by a confidence crisis,"" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard.
The U.S. Treasury is monitoring the situation around Credit Suisse and is in touch with global counterparts, a Treasury spokesperson said.
Asked about the impact of Credit Suisse's problems on the U.S. banking system, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders told Reuters: ""Everybody is concerned.""
On Wall Street, major indexes closed down on Wednesday, with big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) falling. The KBW regional banking index (.KRX) declined 1.57%.
In the United States, large banks have managed their exposure to Credit Suisse in recent months and view risks emanating from the lender as manageable so far, according to three industry sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.
Rapid rises in interest rates have made it harder for some businesses to pay back or service loans, increasing the chances of losses for lenders who are also worried about a recession.
Traders are now betting that the Federal Reserve, which just last week was expected to accelerate its interest-rate-hike campaign in the face of persistent inflation, may be forced to hit pause and even reverse course.
Futures tied to the Fed's policy rate were pricing a slightly better-than-even chance that policymakers will leave their benchmark lending rate in its current 4.5%-4.75% range at their upcoming meeting on March 21-22.
Traders' bets on a large European Central Bank interest-rate hike at Thursday's meeting also evaporated quickly as the Credit Suisse rout fanned fears about the health of Europe's banking sector. Money market pricing suggested traders now saw less than a 20% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike at the ECB meeting.
Unease sparked by SVB's demise has also prompted depositors to seek out new homes for their cash.
Ralph Hamers, CEO of Credit Suisse rival UBS (UBSG.S) said market turmoil has steered more money its way.
""In the last couple of days as you might expect we've seen inflows,"" Hamers said. ""It is clearly a flight to safety from that perspective, but I think three days don't make a trend.""
Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) CEO Christian Sewing said that the German lender has also seen incoming deposits.
Focus is also shifting increasingly to the possibility of tougher rules for banks, particularly mid-tier ones like SVB (SIVB.O) and New York-based Signature Bank (SBNY.O), whose collapses triggered the market tumult.
U.S. Congress needs to act on bipartisan legislation strengthening banking industry controls, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, though Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown downplayed the likelihood of Congress passing a ""significant"" banking bill anytime soon.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Goldman Sachs cuts U.S. GDP forecast after banking crisis,Reuters,2023-03-15 17:03:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/42RAHFD7JJJ23H4DDJAHESALXE.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Wednesday lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth, citing risks to the lending environment as smaller banks pull back on loans to preserve liquidity in the face of a banking crisis.
Analysts at the firm now expect year-over-year growth of 1.2% for the quarter, down 0.3 percentage points from their previous estimate.
Regional banks in the United States have been on a bumpy ride since SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) was shuttered by regulators after a bank run last week.
The rapid unraveling of the startup lender has fueled worries of potential bank runs at peers that could leave them scrambling for funds to meet deposit withdrawal requests.
Goldman Sachs said stress at some banks persists despite federal agencies having acted aggressively to bolster the financial system.
On Tuesday, ratings agency Moody's revised its outlook on the U.S. banking system to ""negative"" from ""stable"".

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,US retail sales point to underlying strength in the economy,Lucia Mutikani,2023-03-15 16:38:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell moderately in February, likely payback after the prior month's outsized increase, but the underlying momentum remained strong, suggesting the economy continued to expand in the first quarter despite higher borrowing costs.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday, which followed on the heels of data last week showing solid job growth in February, prompted economists to upgrade their gross domestic product growth estimates for this quarter. News on inflation was somewhat encouraging. Producer prices fell last month, leading to the smallest year-on-year increase in nearly two years.
Economic data is, however, taking a backseat to the unfolding turmoil in the financial sector, where the recent failure of two regional banks has stoked fears of contagion.
That has left the outlook for next Wednesday's interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve highly uncertain.
""American consumers still appear to be spending at a rate that will make the Fed uncomfortable with the inflation outlook, warranting a further tap on the brakes,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. ""Of course, the Fed now has bigger fish to fry, making next week's decision less dependent on the data and more reliant on how the banking turmoil evolves.""

Retail sales dropped 0.4% last month. Data for January was revised higher to show retail sales rising 3.2% instead of 3.0% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall 0.3%, with estimates ranging from a 1.0% decline to a 0.5% increase.
Retail sales are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation. Economists said challenges adjusting the data for shifts in spending patterns at the end and start of the year as well as higher prices were among the factors that had exaggerated January's retail sales surge.
Last month's decline in retail sales was led by motor vehicle purchases, with receipts at auto dealers dropping 1.8% after accelerating 7.1% in January. Furniture store sales fell 2.5%, while receipts at clothing outlets decreased 0.8%.
Receipts at food services and drinking places, the only services category in the retail sales report, tumbled 2.2%. But online retail sales increased 1.6%, while receipts at electronics and appliance stores rose 0.3%.
Spending is being supported by a tight labor market, which is generating higher wage growth. There were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in January. Consumers still have a huge amount of savings accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial markets saw a 50/50 chance of a quarter-point rate hike or pause at the Fed's policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.
The U.S. central bank has raised its benchmark overnight interest rate by 450 basis points since last March from near-zero to the current 4.50%-4.75% range.
""Recent bank failures and the spike in financial market stress are complicating policymakers' task of reading the economic tea leaves,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""A pause in the hiking cycle would be premature as inflation continues to run hot and GDP growth remains resilient.""
U.S. stocks fell on the banking sector turmoil. The dollar jumped versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
According to Bank of America Securities, an analysis of the bank's card data showed that services spending significantly outperformed goods spending in February. While this suggests the rotation of spending back to services helped to undercut retail sales last month, it should support overall consumer spending.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 0.5% last month. These so-called core retail sales increased 2.3% in January, revised up from the previously reported 1.7%.
Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, was on track to accelerate this quarter, prompting some Wall Street banks, including JPMorgan and Barclays, to boost their GDP forecasts.
The Atlanta Fed raised its first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3.2% annualized rate from a 2.6% pace.
The outlook was, however, tempered by a second report from the Commerce Department showing businesses inventories fell for the first time in nearly two years in January. Inventory accumulation, most of it unwanted, was the major contributor to the economy's 2.7% growth pace in the fourth quarter.
A third report from the Labor Department showed the producer price index for final demand slipped 0.1% in February. Data for January was revised down to show the PPI increasing 0.3% instead of 0.7% as previously reported.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 4.6%. That was the smallest annual gain in the PPI since March 2021 and followed a 5.7% rise in January.
With consumer and producer prices data in hand, economists forecast that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased by about 0.3% in February after surging 0.6% in January. That would lower the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 4.6% from 4.7% in January.
The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for its 2% target.
""The inflation data continues to point toward the need for more restraint on an overheated economy,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Poles feel the pinch as inflation hits peak,Reuters,2023-03-15 14:17:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XSBP7AN6W5KMPO2ZBPI7NXJLSI.jpg,"GDANSK, Poland, March 15 (Reuters) - Polish consumers say they are struggling to pay household bills and buy basic groceries as price rises have reached their steepest in more than a quarter of a century.
Inflation in Poland was 18.4% year on year in February, according to statistics office data released on Wednesday, the highest in 26 years, although economists have predicted it will mark the peak of the current cycle.
""Prices are quite high especially for food recently,"" said Patryk, 29, a product support specialist, who was heading to work in the northern city of Gdansk. ""For example for tomatoes right now you have to pay about 20 zlotys ($4.49) per kilo. The normal price was about 12... This is not something I remember in my life.""
A tight labour market means that emerging Europe's largest economy has continued to post double-digit wage growth, although pay has not kept up with inflation.
""Let's say I am quite lucky as I managed to get a pay rise... it balances out a little bit, but as I said you have to think about what you are buying and if you really need it right now,"" Patryk, who only gave his first name, said.
Across Europe prices have surged, in some cases to multi-decade highs, driven by the impact of the Ukraine war on energy markets, as well as supply chain disruption linked to the pandemic.

The producer price index for final demand slipped 0.1% last month, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. Data for January was revised down to show the PPI increasing 0.3% instead of 0.7% as previously reported.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 4.6% after rising 5.7% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.3% on the month and advancing 5.4% year-on-year.
The government reported on Tuesday that consumer prices rose strongly in February, though the annual increase was the smallest since September 2021.
The decline in the PPI was led by a 0.2% drop in goods prices, which followed a 1.2% increase in January. A 36.1% plunge in the cost of eggs accounted for more than 80% of the decrease in goods prices.
There were also decreases in the prices of residential natural gas, fresh and dry vegetables, diesel fuel, home heating oil, and primary basic organic chemicals. But prices for iron and steel scrap jumped 10.6%. Gasoline prices also rose.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,"For tech giants, AI like Bing and Bard poses billion-dollar search problem",Jeffrey Dastin,2023-02-22 23:49:00+00:00,,"MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Feb 22 (Reuters) - As Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) looks past a chatbot flub that helped erase $100 billion from its market value, another challenge is emerging from its efforts to add generative artificial intelligence to its popular Google Search: the cost.
Executives across the technology sector are talking about how to operate AI like ChatGPT while accounting for the high expense. The wildly popular chatbot from OpenAI, which can draft prose and answer search queries, has ""eye-watering"" computing costs of a couple or more cents per conversation, the startup's Chief Executive Sam Altman has said on Twitter.
In an interview, Alphabet's Chairman John Hennessy told Reuters that having an exchange with AI known as a large language model likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search, though fine-tuning will help reduce the expense quickly.
Even with revenue from potential chat-based search ads, the technology could chip into the bottom line of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet with several billion dollars of extra costs, analysts said. Its net income was nearly $60 billion in 2022.

Morgan Stanley estimated that Google's 3.3 trillion search queries last year cost roughly a fifth of a cent each, a number that would increase depending on how much text AI must generate. Google, for instance, could face a $6-billion hike in expenses by 2024 if ChatGPT-like AI were to handle half the queries it receives with 50-word answers, analysts projected. Google is unlikely to need a chatbot to handle navigational searches for sites like Wikipedia.
Others arrived at a similar bill in different ways. For instance, SemiAnalysis, a research and consulting firm focused on chip technology, said adding ChatGPT-style AI to search could cost Alphabet $3 billion, an amount limited by Google's in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, along with other optimizations.
What makes this form of AI pricier than conventional search is the computing power involved. Such AI depends on billions of dollars of chips, a cost that has to be spread out over their useful life of several years, analysts said. Electricity likewise adds costs and pressure to companies with carbon-footprint goals.
The process of handling AI-powered search queries is known as ""inference,"" in which a ""neural network"" loosely modeled on the human brain's biology infers the answer to a question from prior training.
In a traditional search, by contrast, Google's web crawlers have scanned the internet to compile an index of information. When a user types a query, Google serves up the most relevant answers stored in the index.
Alphabet's Hennessy told Reuters, ""It's inference costs you have to drive down,"" calling that ""a couple year problem at worst.""
Alphabet is facing pressure to take on the challenge despite the expense. Earlier this month, its rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) held a high-profile event at its Redmond, Washington headquarters to show off plans to embed AI chat technology into its Bing search engine, with top executives taking aim at Google's search market share of 91%, by Similarweb's estimate.
A day later, Alphabet talked about plans to improve its search engine, but a promotional video for its AI chatbot Bard showed the system answering a question inaccurately, fomenting a stock slide that shaved $100 billion off its market value.
Microsoft later drew scrutiny of its own when its AI reportedly made threats or professed love to test users, prompting the company to limit long chat sessions it said ""provoked"" unintended answers.
Microsoft's Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has told analysts that the upside from gaining users and advertising revenue outweighed expenses as the new Bing rolls out to millions of consumers. ""That's incremental gross margin dollars for us, even at the cost to serve that we're discussing,"" she said.
And another Google competitor, CEO of search engine You.com Richard Socher, said adding an AI chat experience as well as applications for charts, videos and other generative tech raised expenses between 30% and 50%. ""Technology gets cheaper at scale and over time,"" he said.
A source close to Google cautioned it's early to pin down exactly how much chatbots might cost because efficiency and usage vary widely depending on the technology involved, and AI already powers products like search.
Still, footing the bill is one of two main reasons why search and social media giants with billions of users have not rolled out an AI chatbot overnight, said Paul Daugherty, Accenture's chief technology officer.
""One is accuracy, and the second is you have to scale this in the right way,"" he said.
For years, researchers at Alphabet and elsewhere have studied how to train and run large language models more cheaply.
Bigger models require more chips for inference and therefore cost more. AI that dazzles consumers for its human-like authority has ballooned in size, reaching 175 billion so-called parameters, or different values that the algorithm takes into account, for the model OpenAI updated into ChatGPT. Cost also varies by the length of a user's query, as measured in ""tokens"" or pieces of words.
One senior technology executive told Reuters that such AI remained cost-prohibitive to put in millions of consumers' hands.
""These models are very expensive, and so the next level of invention is going to be reducing the cost of both training these models and inference so that we can use it in every application,"" the executive said on condition of anonymity.
For now, computer scientists inside OpenAI have figured out how to optimize inference costs through complex code that makes chips run more efficiently, a person familiar with the effort said. An OpenAI spokesperson did not immediately comment.
A longer-term issue is how to shrink the number of parameters in an AI model 10 or even 100 times, without losing accuracy.
""How you cull (parameters away) most effectively, that's still an open question,"" said Naveen Rao, who formerly ran Intel Corp's AI chip efforts and now works to lower AI computing costs through his startup MosaicML.
In the meantime, some have considered charging for access, like OpenAI's $20 per month subscription for better ChatGPT service. Technology experts also said a workaround is applying smaller AI models to simpler tasks, which Alphabet is exploring.
The company said this month a ""smaller model"" version of its massive LaMDA AI technology will power its chatbot Bard, requiring ""significantly less computing power, enabling us to scale to more users.""
Asked about chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, Hennessy said at a conference called TechSurge last week that more focused models, rather than one system doing everything, would help ""tame the cost.""

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,UK launches competition to support small nuclear reactors,Reuters,2023-03-15 14:27:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - British finance minister Jeremy Hunt said he would boost investment in nuclear power by launching a competition for small modular reactors (SMRs), such as those being developed by Rolls-Royce , and funding if the technology proved to be viable.
Britain aims to replace its ageing nuclear power stations as all but one of the plants, which generate around 13% of the country's electricity, are due to close by 2030.
Large-scale nuclear projects with huge up-front costs have struggled to attract investment, putting the focus on smaller, cheaper reactors.
""I am launching the first competition for Small Modular Reactors,"" Hunt said in his budget statement on Wednesday.
""It will be completed by the end of this year and if demonstrated to be viable we will co-fund this exciting new technology.""
Britain previously announced a competition for SMRs in the 2015 Autumn Statement with the first phase opening in 2016 and attracting interest from 33 eligible parties.

It closed in 2017 without moving beyond the initial, information gathering first stage.
Last year the government committed 210 million pounds to Rolls-Royce for its 500-million pound SMR programme which could see the company open factories to build the reactors in Britain.
""Rolls-Royce SMR has called for rapid progress from the Government and we welcome the adoption of that principle in this process,"" Tom Samson CEO of Rolls-Royce SMR said in a statement.
In the budget, Hunt also said he would consult on classing nuclear power as ""environmentally sustainable"" to encourage more private investment into the sector.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Explainer: What is Microsoft-backed OpenAI's GPT-4 model?,Reuters,2023-03-15 18:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7OM4B4UKFVJWXOWLWYD36B22WA.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp-backed (MSFT.O) startup OpenAI began the rollout of GPT-4, a powerful artificial intelligence model that succeeds the technology behind the wildly popular ChatGPT.
GPT-4 is ""multimodal"", which means it can generate content from both image and text prompts.
GPT-3.5 takes only text prompts, whereas the latest version of the large language model can also use images as inputs to recognize objects in a picture and analyze them.
GPT-3.5 is limited to about 3,000-word responses, while GPT-4 can generate responses of more than 25,000 words.
GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content than its predecessor and scores 40% higher on certain tests of factuality.
It will also let developers decide their AI's style of tone and verbosity. For example, GPT-4 can assume a Socratic style of conversation and respond to questions with questions. The previous iteration of the technology had a fixed tone and style.
View 2 more stories 
Soon ChatGPT users will have the option to change the chatbot's tone and style of responses, OpenAI said.
The latest version has outperformed its predecessor in the U.S. bar exam and the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). GPT-4 can also help individuals calculate their taxes, a demonstration by Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, showed.
The demo showed it could take a photo of a hand-drawn mock-up for a simple website and create a real one.
Be My Eyes, an app that caters to visually impaired people, will provide a virtual volunteer tool powered by GPT-4 on its app.
According to OpenAI, GPT-4 has similar limitations as its prior versions and is ""less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios"".
Inaccurate responses known as ""hallucinations"" have been a challenge for many AI programs, including GPT-4.
OpenAI said GPT-4 can rival human propagandists in many domains, especially when teamed up with a human editor.
It cited an example where GPT-4 came up with suggestions that seemed plausible, when it was asked about how to get two parties to disagree with each other.
OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman said GPT-4 was ""most capable and aligned"" with human values and intent, though ""it is still flawed.""
GPT-4 generally lacks knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021, when the vast majority of its data was cut off. It also does not learn from experience.
While GPT-4 can process both text and image inputs, only the text-input feature will be available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and software developers, with a waitlist, while the image-input ability is not publicly available yet.
The subscription plan, which offers faster response time and priority access to new features and improvements, was launched in February and costs $20 per month.
GPT-4 powers Microsoft's Bing AI chatbot and some features on language learning platform Duolingo's (DUOL.O) subscription tier.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Fintech startup Stripe integrating OpenAI's new GPT-4 AI,Anna Tong,2023-03-15 15:01:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PCHZ3PMTNRJ4PDY56OOKANCP7Y.jpg,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 15 - Fintech startup Stripe is starting to integrate OpenAI's latest GPT-4 artificial intelligence model into its digital payment processing and other products, Stripe said on Wednesday.
The news followed an announcement by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI that it would release GPT-4, a new version of the powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technology that has powered chatbot sensation ChatGPT.
The Stripe move represents one of the first known integrations of OpenAI's new technology, underscoring large companies' interest in embedding AI in their product offerings.
There are currently 14 GPT-4 prototypes in the works at San Francisco-based Stripe, said Emily Sands, Stripe's head of information.
The first offering will be a way for Stripe's software developers to type out a question and receive summarized answers instead of having to search through developer documentation, Sands said.
Another test in the works allows Stripe's customers to make queries about their business analytics using natural language instead of needing to write database queries, she added.

OpenAI will also use Stripe's payment processing engine to charge its users, including for its ChatGPT Plus subscription, as well as to buy credits for the DALL-E image-generation product, according to Stripe.
As competition in AI heats up, it remains unclear whether companies will be able to successfully commercialize their products and charge users for them.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Quantum computer startup SEEQC unveils digital chip that operates at super cold temp,Jane Lee,2023-03-15 14:06:00+00:00,,"OAKLAND, Calif March 15 (Reuters) - New York-based quantum computer startup SEEQC said on Wednesday it has developed a digital chip that can operate at temperatures colder than outer space so it can be used with quantum processors that are often in cryogenic chambers.
Quantum computers, based on quantum physics, have the potential one day to complete some calculations millions of times faster than the most powerful supercomputer today.
One challenge is that quantum processors with quantum bits, or qubits, often need to be stored at very cold temperatures near zero Kelvin, or -273.15 Celsius. On the other hand, classical computers operate in more moderate temperatures.
But the two need to be paired as information from the quantum processors is measured in wave form and must be digitized into ones and zeros for classical computers used to control and access the qubits.

Today wires connect the quantum processor in the freezing chamber to classical computers in room temperature, but the temperature change can slow the speed and cause other issues. SEEQC has also built its quantum computer this way and is now trying to modify it with its new chips.
""If you're trying to build a data center, if that's your goal, then it's not enough to take these kind of early prototype designs and try to scale them on a brute force manner,"" John Levy, co-founder and CEO of SEEQC told Reuters.
The first chip it unveiled Wednesday sits directly under the quantum processor and controls the qubits, and reads out the results.
At least two other chips still under development will be in a slightly warmer part of the cryogenic chamber. These could further process information needed for quantum computing.
The technology could make it easier to build more powerful quantum computers as each cryogenic chamber would be able to support a larger number of qubits, said Levy. Today's superconducting quantum computers have hundreds of qubits, but some estimate thousands, or even a million could be needed to create a quantum computer to run useful algorithms.
The SEEQC digital chips are made at SEEQC's fabrication facility in Elmsford using silicon wafers but do not use transistors, Levy said.
SEEQC was founded in 2018 and has raised a total of $30 million from investors including Merck's M Ventures and LG Tech Ventures.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Microsoft-backed OpenAI starts release of powerful AI known as GPT-4,Jeffrey Dastin,2023-03-15 00:38:00+00:00,,"March 14 (Reuters) - The startup OpenAI on Tuesday said it is beginning to release a powerful artificial intelligence model known as GPT-4, setting the stage for human-like technology to proliferate and more competition between its backer Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google.
OpenAI, which created the chatbot sensation ChatGPT, said in a blog post that its latest technology is ""multimodal,"" meaning images as well as text prompts can spur it to generate content. The text-input feature will be available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and to software developers, with a waitlist, while the image-input ability remains a preview of its research.
The highly-anticipated launch signals how office workers may turn to ever-improving AI for still more tasks, as well as how technology companies are locked in competition to win business from such advances.
Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google on Tuesday announced a ""magic wand"" for its collaboration software that can draft virtually any document, days before Microsoft is expected to showcase AI for its competing Word processor, likely powered by OpenAI. A Microsoft executive also said that GPT-4 is helping power its Bing search engine.

OpenAI's latest technology in some cases represented a vast improvement on a prior version known as GPT-3.5, it said. In a simulation of the bar exam required of U.S. law school graduates before professional practice, the new model scored around the top 10% of test takers, versus the older model ranking around the bottom 10%, OpenAI said.
While the two versions can appear similar in casual conversation, ""the difference comes out when the complexity of the task reaches a sufficient threshold,"" OpenAI said, noting ""GPT-4 is more reliable, creative, and able to handle much more nuanced instructions.""
An online demonstration of the technology by Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, showed it could take a photo of a hand-drawn mock-up for a simple website and create a real website based on it. GPT-4 also could help individuals calculate their taxes, the demonstration showed.
Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, on Twitter called GPT-4 its model ""most capable and aligned"" with human values and intent, though ""it is still flawed.""
GPT-4 is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content than its predecessor and scores 40% higher on certain tests of factuality, the company said. Inaccurate responses known as ""hallucinations"" have been a challenge for many AI programs.
Microsoft stands to benefit from GPT-4's adoption, said Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
The software maker not only is integrating OpenAI's latest technology into its products: its Azure cloud is powering usage of OpenAI just as budget-conscious businesses are scrutinizing IT spend in an uncertain economy, he said.
""Whenever a company uses this piece of technology,"" Jaluria said, ""those workloads go through Microsoft Azure, and I think this is coming at a very critical time.""

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Google unveils 'magic wand' to draft documents as AI race tightens,Jeffrey Dastin,2023-03-14 13:07:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XNUHVXBSQZP2BKJEMKYSFI7A44.jpg,"PALO ALTO, California, March 14 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google on Tuesday unveiled a flurry of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for its email, collaboration and cloud software, taking aim at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) days before its rival is expected to make a similar announcement.
In a replay of last month's dueling chatbot launches by the tech giants, Alphabet touted a ""magic wand"" for its popular Google Docs software that can draft a marketing blog, training plan or other text, then revise its tone at users' discretion, a company official demonstrated to reporters.
Microsoft, meanwhile, has teased a Thursday event about how it is ""reinventing productivity with AI,"" which is expected to showcase its competing Word processor.
Alphabet also said its AI will be able to summarize message threads in Gmail, craft slide presentations, personalize customer outreach and take meeting notes as part of its upgrade to Google Workspace, a product suite with billions of users on free and paid accounts.

The advances reflect how ChatGPT has spurred a race in Silicon Valley to imbue products with so-called generative AI, which learns from past data how to create content anew, just like the chatbot sensation.
Microsoft, Alphabet and peers are investing billions of dollars to build and deploy the technology, hoping business they win from speeding up writing and creative tasks for office workers will far outweigh the costs of these endeavors.
""This next phase is where we're bringing human beings to be supported with an AI collaborator, who is working in real time,"" Thomas Kurian, Chief Executive of Google Cloud, said in a press briefing.
Alphabet is giving approved test users access to new Workspace features on a rolling basis throughout the year, before a wider launch, similar to it and Microsoft's phased release of their chatbot programs.
Kurian declined to say how much the upgraded Workspace might cost businesses or consumers.
Google also unveiled a range of generative AI tools for its cloud-computing customers, for instance previewing access to PaLM, one of its most powerful ""large language models"" that create human-like text.
Google said customers can fine-tune its AI model with their own data while keeping the information and benefits proprietary.
In another enterprise software example, Google showed how a fictional furniture business could build better customer-service chatbots capable of generating images as well as text, like showing how a corgi dog would look on a mid-century modern chair.
The chatbot could integrate with a payments system so a shopper then could buy the chair, a promotional video showed.
Google aims for its AI to ""transform"" the work of marketers, lawyers, scientists and educators, according to the video.
The Mountain View, California-based company announced a partnership with high-profile AI research lab Midjourney, with Google to provide cloud infrastructure including its custom ""TPU"" chips.
Microsoft's generative-AI rollout so far has outpaced that of Alphabet, which is wary of societal harm as well as damage to its reputation as a reliable source of information.
Such software remains prone to inaccurate responses known as ""hallucinations"".
A factual error that Alphabet's chatbot Bard made in a demo last month contributed to a $100 billion slump in its market value, though Microsoft drew scrutiny of its own when its Bing search chatbot professed love or made threats to test users.
Kurian said Google remains ""deeply committed to responsible AI,"" giving controls to customers and reviewing proper use of its products. Microsoft has also added safeguards to its search software.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Twitter rival Koo integrates ChatGPT to help users create content,Sheila Dang,2023-03-14 11:53:00+00:00,,"March 13 (Reuters) - Koo, an India-based social media app that aims to rival Twitter, has integrated OpenAI's ChatGPT to help users more easily create posts, the company's co-founder told Reuters.
ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence bot that can create prose in response to prompts and has set off a tech industry craze over generative AI.
Koo users will be able to use ChatGPT directly within the app to help them draft posts about current events, politics or pop culture, said Mayank Bidawatka, co-founder of Koo, in an interview.
""This will help creators get inspiration on what to create,"" he said. ""They could ask (ChatGPT) for the trending news in their region and then write their thoughts.""
Last month, tech giants Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google each announced their own generative AI chatbots which can synthesize information across the web in response to searches. Snap Inc (SNAP.N), which owns photo messaging app Snapchat, also introduced a chatbot that was trained to have a fun and friendly tone.
View 2 more stories 
Bidawatka said Koo will be the first platform to integrate the technology into the ability to compose posts. Users can either type their prompts into the ChatGPT tool or use Koo's voice command feature.
About 20% of Koo users actively create content on the app and the ChatGPT integration could help increase that figure, he added.
The feature will roll out first to verified accounts on Koo and eventually become available to all users.
In a demo to Reuters, the tool drafted a post using a quote from Albert Einstein and included three related hashtags.
Koo will also explore adding labels to indicate whether a post was created with the help of ChatGPT.
""I think people should know if content is AI-generated,"" Bidawatka said.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Spain's race to space about to blast off with reusable rocket launch,Reuters,2023-03-13 17:43:00+00:00,,"MADRID, March 13 (Reuters) - Two Spanish engineers hope to put their country at the forefront of the space transport industry with the launch of what could be the first private reusable rocket from Western Europe later this year.
Raul Torres and Raul Verdu, who work for Spanish launch company PLD Space, have named their suborbital microlauncher ""Miura 1"" after a renowned breed of bull in Spain's bullfighting tradition.
The microlauncher is as tall as a three-storey building, has a 100-kg (220-lb) cargo capacity and can also be used to carry zero-gravity experiments.
PLD Space aims to launch the rocket in Huelva in southern Spain, paving the way for commercial launches further down the road, but no date has been set.
Unveiling the rocket at the launch site at a military base on Saturday, PLD Space's executive president, Ezequiel Sanchez, said it demonstrated Spain's ""technological leadership in Europe"".
London-based Orbex is also working to deliver small satellites into low Earth orbit from Scotland, with no launch date scheduled yet.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who was present on Saturday, hailed the microlauncher's development as an important step towards fulfilling the country's space ambitions.
""This is something we should share among the whole of Spanish society which will put Spain at the vanguard of this emerging but potent industry,"" he said.
Spain launched its own state space agency on March 7 amid a push by European countries to keep pace with global rivals.
The Spanish Space Agency, based in the southern city of Seville, will have a budget of 700 million euros ($745 million) in its first year and a staff of 75.
In November, European nations agreed to boost spending on space by 17% to keep on the heels of the United States and China.
Spain's international position in the aerospace sector has been bolstered not only by increased public spending but by the European Space Agency's recruitment of the first two Spanish astronauts in 30 years, Pablo Alvarez and Sara Garcia.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,"Suspected Chinese hackers tampered with widely used customer chat program, researchers say",Raphael Satter,2022-09-30 22:36:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FZOCLNI7QJPZHKLEYZGZMZMUZ4.jpg,"WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Suspected Chinese hackers tampered with widely used software distributed by a small Canadian customer service company, another example of a ""supply chain compromise"" made infamous by the hack on U.S. networking company SolarWinds.
U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said in a blog post it had discovered malicious software being distributed by Vancouver-based Comm100, which provides customer service products, such as chat bots and social media management tools, to a range of clients around the globe.
The scope and scale of the hack was not immediately clear. In a message, Comm100 said it had fixed its software earlier Thursday and that more details would soon be forthcoming. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up requests for information.
CrowdStrike researchers believe the malicious software was in circulation for a couple of days but would not say how many companies had been affected, divulging only that ""entities across a range of industries"" were hit. A person familiar with the matter cited a dozen known victims, although the actual figure could be much higher.

Comm100 on its website said it had more than 15,000 customers in some 80 countries.
CrowdStrike executive Adam Meyers said in a telephone interview that the hackers were suspected to be Chinese, citing their patterns of behavior, language in the code, and the fact that one victim had repeatedly been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.
The Chinese government rejected the claim. In an email, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said officials in Beijing ""firmly oppose and crack down on all forms of cyber hacking in accordance with the law"" and that the United States ""has been loudly active in fabricating and spreading lies about so-called 'Chinese hackers.'""
Supply chain compromises – which work by tampering with widely used enterprise software to hack its clients downstream – have been of increasing concern since alleged Russian hackers broke into Texas IT management firm SolarWinds Corp (SWI.N) and used it as a springboard to hack U.S. government agencies and a host of private firms.
Meyers, whose firm was among those that responded to the SolarWinds hack, said the Comm100 find was a reminder that other nations used the same techniques.
""China is engaging in supply chain attacks,"" he said.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,"Tesla's robot waves but can't walk, yet. Musk plans to make millions of them",Hyunjoo Jin,2022-10-03 00:37:00+00:00,,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk showed off on Friday a prototype of its humanoid robot 'Optimus', predicting the electric vehicle maker would be able to produce millions and sell them for under $20,000 - less than a third of the price of a Model Y.
Musk said he expected Tesla would be ready to take orders for the robot in three to five years, and described an effort to develop the product over a decade or more, the most detailed vision he has provided to date on a business he has said could be bigger than Tesla's EV revenue.
Tesla's push to design and build mass-market robots that would also be tested by working jobs in its factories sets it apart from other manufacturers that have experimented with humanoid robots.
The eagerly awaited reveal of prototype robots at Tesla's office in Palo Alto, California was also part of what Musk has described as an effort to have Tesla seen as a leader in fields like artificial intelligence, not just a company that makes ""cool cars.""
View 2 more stories 
An experimental test robot that Tesla said was developed in February walked out to wave at the crowd on Friday, and Tesla showed a video of it doing simple tasks, such as watering plants, carrying boxes and lifting metal bars at a production station at the company's California plant.
But a more streamlined current one, which Musk said was closer to what he hoped to put into production, had to be rolled out on a platform and did a slow wave to the crowd. Musk called it Optimus and said it would be able to walk in a few weeks.
""There's still a lot of work to be done to refine Optimus and prove it,"" Musk said, adding later, ""I think Optimus is going to be incredible in five or 10 years, like mind blowing.""
He said existing humanoid robots are “missing a brain” – and the ability to solve problems on their own. By contrast, he said, Optimus would be an ""extremely capable robot"" that Tesla would aim to produce in the millions.
Other automakers, including Toyota Motor (7203.T) and Honda Motor (7267.T), have developed humanoid robot prototypes capable of doing complicated things like shooting a basketball, and production robots from ABB and others are a mainstay of auto manufacturing.
But Tesla is alone in pushing the market opportunity for a mass-market robot that could also be used in factory work.
The next-generation Tesla bot will use Tesla-designed components, including a 2.3-kWh battery pack carried in its torso, a chip system and actuators to drive its limbs. The robot is designed to weigh 73 kg.
Tesla engineers, who like Musk were all wearing black T-shirts with an image of metallic robotic hands making a heart shape, described how they developed the robot's features - including in areas like how the fingers move - with a focus on making the cost of production lower.
""We are trying to follow the goal of fastest path to a useful robot that can be made at volume,"" Musk said.
By developing a robotics business, Musk said, Tesla is shifting the terms of a well-known mission statement that has become part of its appeal to investors and climate activists by committing to ""accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.""
""Optimus is not directly in line with accelerating sustainable energy,"" Musk said. ""I think the mission does somewhat broaden with the advent of Optimus to - you know, I don't know: making the future awesome.""
Musk has described the event as intended to recruit workers, and the engineers on stage catered to a technical audience. They detailed the process by which Tesla designed robot hands and used crash-simulator technology to test the robot’s ability to fall on its face without breaking.
Musk, who has spoken before about the risks of artificial intelligence, said the mass rollout of robots had the potential to “transform civilization” and create “a future of abundance, a future of no poverty.” But he said he believed it was important that Tesla shareholders had a role in vetting the company’s efforts.
“If I go crazy, you can fire me,” Musk said. “This is important.”
Many reactions on Twitter were positive, focusing on the speed of Tesla's development effort since August last year, when Tesla announced its project with a stunt that had a person in a white suit simulate a humanoid robot.
Henri Ben Amor, a robotics professor at Arizona State University, said Musk's price target of $20,000 was a ""good proposition,"" since current costs are about $100,000 for humanoid robots.
""There's some discrepancy between sort of the ambition and what they have presented,"" he said. ""When it comes to dexterity, speed, the ability to walk in a stable fashion and so on, there's still a lot of work to be done.""
Aaron Johnson, a mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, also said the robot's need was debatable.
""What is really impressive is that they got to that level so quickly. What is still a little murky is what exactly the use case is for them to make millions of these,"" Johnson said.
Tesla also discussed its long-delayed self-driving technology at the event. Engineers working on the auto self-driving software described how they trained software to choose actions, such as when to merge into traffic, and how they sped up the computer decision-making process.
In May, Musk said that the world's most valuable car maker would be ""worth basically zero"" without achieving full self-driving capability, and it faces growing regulatory probes, as well as technological hurdles.
Musk said on Friday beta testing of Tesla's full self-driving capability will be ""technically"" ready for global rollout by the end of 2022, but regulations represent hurdles.

The country has received approval for an additional 1.3 million cholera vaccine doses to help control the spread, the agency said, but the shortage of vaccines still remains to be addressed.
Mozambique's neighbor Malawi, which has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, was now seeing a sustained decline in cases and deaths, WHO official and epidemiologist Dr Otim Ramadan said.
Zambia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are also responding to cholera outbreaks.
The progress to bring down the transmission of the disease in Malawi in the last four weeks may reverse quickly due to severe devastation caused by the Tropical Storm Freddy, Ramadan warned.
Overall, cholera cases and deaths in Africa have been declining over recent weeks.
So far this year, more than 40,000 cases have been reported in Africa, with Malawi accounting for more than half and Mozambique recording about 15%, WHO reported.

Business,/business/energy/,Oil regains some ground after Credit Suisse lifeline,Ahmad Ghaddar,2023-03-16 11:43:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 16 - Oil prices clawed back some ground on Thursday, recovering from the previous session's 15-month lows, as markets calmed somewhat after Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) was thrown a financial lifeline by Swiss regulators.
But market sentiment remained fragile, battered by fears of growing stress on banks worldwide, and both the main crude benchmarks gave up some of Thursday's early gains.
Brent crude futures were up 54 cents, or 0.7%, at $74.23 a barrel by 1105 GMT. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) rose 43 cents, or 0.6%, to $68.04.
On Wednesday, the third straight day of declines, U.S. crude fell below $70 a barrel for the first time since Dec. 20, 2021.
Brent has lost nearly 10% since Friday's close while U.S. crude is down about 11%.
""Oil dropped below $70 a barrel amid fears of a second financial crisis hurting the demand outlook,"" said City Index analyst Fiona Cincotta. ""Today the market mood has improved after Credit Suisse was thrown a financial lifeline.""
View 2 more stories 
Credit Suisse said on Thursday that it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to shore up its liquidity and investor confidence after a slump in its shares intensified fears about a global financial crisis.
Those fears could crowd out inflation worries when European Central Bank policymakers meet on Thursday, possibly forcing them to ditch plans for a hefty interest rate hike that could slow economic growth and dent oil demand.
A fall in U.S. fuel stocks last week also supported oil prices. While Energy Information Administration data showed that crude inventories rose by 1.6 million barrels, gasoline and distillates stocks fell by a combined 4.6 million barrels.
OPEC's rosier outlook for China oil demand was also supportive, said Lim Tai An, analyst at Phillip Nova.
The oil producer group raised its 2023 China demand forecast this week and a monthly report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) on Wednesday flagged an expected boost to oil demand from resumed air travel and China's economic reopening after abandoning its zero-COVID policy.
But oversupply concerns remain.
The IEA report said that commercial oil stocks in developed OECD countries have hit an 18-month high while Russian oil output in February stayed near levels registered before the war in Ukraine despite sanctions on its seaborne exports.

Carlos Orellana, head of livestock protection for Chile's farming and livestock SAG agency, said it was a ""limited event"" and authorities haven't detected more cases in the surrounding area.
""It's a very limited event, our surveillance in the peripheral region keeps giving us negative results,"" Orellana said during a press conference in Santiago, adding that the culled birds represent a small fraction of the country's 30 million poultry.
""We hope to have this situation contained and that Chile regains its status of being free of highly pathogenic bird flu,"" he added.
The outbreak was detected on Monday in a plant belonging to meat producer Agrosuper, in Rancagua in central Chile, leading the government to suspend chicken exports for a 28-day period.
Cases of bird flu, mostly in wild animals, have been detected in Chile since late last year. Argentina confirmed its first case in industrial poultry last month, causing it to suspend avian product exports.

BrahMos, a joint venture between India and Russia, clinched its first foreign deal last year with a $375 million sale of shore-based anti-ship missiles to the Philippines - part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious push to triple defence exports.
The company has been in protracted negotiations with Indonesia and details about the size and timeline of a potential deal have not been previously reported.
BrahMos Aerospace CEO Atul D. Rane said that it was in advanced discussions with Jakarta on a deal worth $200 million to $350 million under which it had offered to supply shore-based missiles and a version that can be mounted on warships.
""I have a team right now in Jakarta,"" Rane told Reuters in an interview, adding that a deal could be in place within the year. ""The defence forces of Indonesia are extremely interested.""

A spokesperson for Indonesian Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto on Wednesday declined to give immediate comment and said he needed to first check the information.
BrahMos is also aiming to land a follow-on order of around $300 million with the Philippines, where its missiles are scheduled to be delivered to the Philippine Marine Corps starting at the end of 2023, Rane said.
""The Philippines themselves have sort of indicated to us that this is just an ice breaker,"" Rane said, referring to the 2022 sale. ""They are looking at more systems.""
A spokesperson for the Philippine Department of National Defence did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In response to a growing Chinese maritime presence in the South China Sea and some surrounding areas, Indonesia and the Philippines have ramped up their spending on the procurement of weapons and other military equipment, according to data from defence intelligence company Janes.
Indonesia's investment in the acquisition of new weapons grew by nearly 28% in 2021 and 69% in 2022, while the Philippines saw a rise of 29% in 2021 and 40% in 2022 - far higher than the average in Southeast Asia, the data shows.
""Territorial disputes with China have been a major concern for most of the Southeast Asian countries which is driving their defence budget to meet their security requirements,"" said Akash Pratim Debbarma, an aerospace and defence analyst at GlobalData.
Much of Southeast Asia's new military purchases come from traditional suppliers, including the United States, France and Russia, but India - the world's largest defence importer - and BrahMos are trying to make inroads.
""We have got the go-ahead to market to every country in southeast Asia from both the government of India and the government of Russia,"" said Rane.
BrahMos was established through an inter-governmental agreement in 1998 as a joint venture between India's state-run Defence Research and Development Organisation and NPO Mashinostroyenia of Russia.
Western-led sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine have not impacted BrahMos production or planning, said Rane.
Although BrahMos missiles still depend on Russian parts and raw material, Rane said the percentage of local input had gone up to over 70% from around 15% at the start of the venture.

""A key rating factor across the region is continuing depositor and stakeholder confidence,"" S&P said. ""Prudent funding and liquidity management will remain integral to ratings stability.""

The company will work with partners in the industry to offer more services and cover more cities, it said in an online statement posted on Thursday that cited a speech at an event in the coastal city of Fuzhou.
""Currently, traveling and consumption are quickly recovering across China. The number of orders for online ride-hailing is constantly increasing,"" the statement said.
The Chinese company had been a target of Beijing's sweeping crackdown on the tech sector, which began in 2021 and had eased in recent months. Didi was banned by Chinese regulators from taking in new users and its app was removed from app stores from mid-2021 until this January.

In January, Didi said in a statement it had been given the green light from domestic regulators to resume new user registrations for its core ride-hailing app. Chinese policymakers are seeking to restore private-sector confidence and tap the technology sector to help spur an economy ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Business,/business/sustainable-business/,EU unveils plans to lead in green industrial revolution,Philip Blenkinsop,2023-03-16 11:42:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7BL5WKXN7BO2JGIIDMYFVSA5II.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission presented one of the centrepieces of its strategy on Thursday to ensure its industry can compete with the United States and China in making clean tech products and accessing raw materials required for the green transition.
The EU executive's Net-Zero Industry Act and Critical Raw Materials Act, part of its Green Deal Industrial Plan, are designed to ensure the bloc is not just a frontrunner in cutting carbon emissions, but also ahead on the technology required to do so. There are signs it is lagging.
Global investment in the green transition is set to triple by 2030 from $1 trillion last year, President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday, declaring ""the race is on"".
The EU executive set targets for the region to mine 10% of the critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt and rare earths it consumes, with recycling adding a further 15%, and increase processing to 40% of its needs by 2030.
View 2 more stories 
The supply of minerals vital for the green transition is a challenge, with China processing almost 90% of rare earths and 60% of lithium, a key element for batteries.
The Commission said no more than 65% of any key raw material should come from a single third country.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has reinforced a lesson learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely that the EU cannot rely on a single supplier for essential materials.
The EU executive would recognise firm plans to mine or process raw materials as ""strategic projects"", which could benefit from streamlined permits and access to financing.
In trade, the EU would seek to expand its network of raw materials partnerships and free trade agreements, such as with Australia, Canada and Chile, and forge a global raw materials alliance.
The EU is also due to set a target of producing at least 40% of the clean tech products it needs by 2030, partly by streamlining the granting of permits for green projects and by fostering investment.
The Commission will propose simpler state aid schemes, allowing subsidies to promote green technology, with the possibility of offering tax breaks using existing EU funds.

Business,/business/aerospace-defense/,"After strategic 787 wins, Boeing jet battle shifts to factory floor",Valerie Insinna,2023-03-15 20:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5RAPY3BEAFOLBGVSZLZTUS2CHE.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - A major purchase by Saudi Arabia caps sales of almost 200 Dreamliners over the past four months, handing Boeing Co (BA.N) major industrial and political wins in lucrative widebody sales against European rival Airbus (AIR.PA).
Now the U.S. aerospace giant will face the difficult task of producing and delivering those 787s in a time of unprecedented supply chain pressures, analysts said.
On Tuesday, Boeing announced orders for 78 Dreamliners, split between state-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) and new national airline Riyadh Air.
The $37 billion sale, which Boeing called its fifth-largest commercial order by value, followed a deal with United Airlines (UAL.O) in December for 100 Dreamliners and a purchase by Air India that included 20 787s.
Those orders fill out Boeing’s backlog at a time when the company aims to boost production to 10 a month by 2026 – a target that would take “supersonic” growth given that Boeing is still working to increase production back to three a month, said Vertical Research analyst Robert Stallard.

“We've seen the orders are there to back up those rate ramps but ... it's not an issue of demand, it's going to be an issue of supply,” Stallard said. “They've got to go out and actually make the aircraft.”
The 787 faces multiple strains on its supply chain, several of which are shared broadly across the aviation industry, such as forgings and castings for engines. Planemakers are also grappling with the after-effects of the pandemic, which forced waves of layoffs and retirements of skilled workers.
However, the Dreamliner line has dealt with several unique challenges, including a year-long delivery pause due to production quality problems that were resolved last August.
In February, Boeing's chief financial officer, Brian West, said the planemaker had to lower 787 production from three aircraft a month due to slower fuselage production at Spirit Aerosystems. The company also confirmed last month that it would need to replace a noncompliant component before delivering certain 787s.
While Airbus outsold Boeing in the Air India deal, landing orders for 40 A350 widebodys, the U.S. planemaker swept both the United Airlines and Saudi orders.
The Saudi deal in particular was seen as a blow for Airbus which just months ago had been expected to land part of the order. Negotiations ebbed back and forth over the past year, echoing a volatile period in U.S.-Saudi relations.
In October sources said Airbus may win an order for 40 of its A350 jets after Washington said it was reviewing options for Saudi relations in a dispute over oil output levels.
Since then, diplomats and regional experts have said the United States and Saudi Arabia are trying to move beyond last year's low point in ties, as security concerns align over the threat from Iranian drones.
Both Washington and Paris weighed in with lobbying, with Riyadh’s final decision taken at the highest level, according to two people familiar with the negotiations.
One European source called the outcome of the plane order ""totally political,"" but a U.S. official denied there had been any diplomatic trade-offs.
“Saudi Airlines is a government-owned airline, and so there are politics involved with this,” analyst Stallard said. ""I wouldn't rule out buying from Airbus if the Saudi government ... thinks its in their best interest to do some things with the Europeans in the future.”

Oil sank to a 15-month low on Wednesday, with Brent crude below $72 a barrel, on concerns about contagion from a banking crisis. Crude stabilised on Thursday after Credit Suisse was thrown a financial lifeline by Swiss regulators.

""We are focusing on market fundamentals,"" another of the sources said.
Last November, with prices weakening, OPEC+ reduced its output target by 2 million bpd - the largest cut since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The same reduction applies for the whole of 2023.

Business,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,Novo Nordisk suspended from UK lobby group,Natalie Grover,2023-03-16 10:47:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QS2HKPIG5VJDPCACOJA74BEON4.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk (NOVOb.CO) has been suspended from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) for two years over what the ABPI on Thursday described as ""serious breaches"" of its code of practice.
ABPI's statement linked to a website of a self-regulatory body run by the association that pointed to a complaint alleging that Novo Nordisk had sponsored courses on weight management on LinkedIn for health professionals, without making clear the company's involvement.
The move amounted to ""bribing health professionals with an inducement to prescribe,"" the complaint alleged.
In response, Novo said that it had agreed to provide sponsorship to ensure that health professionals would receive training from a reputable provider, but that it had supported the activity at ""arms length"".
However, an ABPI panel concluded that the company's provision of funding for health professionals, including training over two years on how to set up a weight-loss service, was clearly linked to the promotion of its drug Saxenda and intended to directly increase its use.

""While we are disappointed with this outcome, we accept the decision. We will remain committed to following the ABPI Code of Practice and maintaining the highest possible ethical standards required by the pharmaceutical industry,"" a company spokesperson said.
This is only eighth time in the past four decades the ABPI has issued such a significant sanction.
Novo will subject to audits in 2023 and 2024, where it will need to show ""clear, significant and sustained improvement"" for the ABPI board to consider allowing the company to resume membership after the two-year suspension.
The suspension follows the departure of Pinder Sahota, Novo's British business head, who resigned from his role as ABPI president last month to avoid the breach becoming a ""distraction"" from the association's ""vital work"" while the complaint was being investigated.
Novo is the market leader in the rapidly growing area of weight loss through medicinal treatment rather than only dieting or exercising.
Wealthy nations are grappling with fast-climbing rates of obesity and related conditions such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease.
Saxenda is an older drug that has been approved for weight loss. Novo has since developed a more effective obesity treatment called Wegovy, which has been in great demand globally and is being lined up for its UK launch.

Business,/business/autos-transportation/,"U.S. retailers' ocean shipping price woes ending, but new delays threaten",Lisa Baertlein,2023-02-27 21:04:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VSLO2EAKABO3VMQUDMSCLDVMHA.jpg,"LONG BEACH, Calif., Feb 27 (Reuters) - Collapsing ocean shipping rates would seem to be good news for U.S. retailers, but they are now bracing for delays as some carriers try to prop up prices by cancelling voyages.
Retailers had paid as much as $20,000 to move a container of goods during the worst pandemic disruptions.
Carriers like MSC and Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) are trying to boost prices by cancelling voyages, which could spark a new round of cargo delays as containers get bumped from one ship to the next, experts said ahead of a major U.S. ocean shipping conference in Long Beach, California, this week.
The event, called TPM23, marks the unofficial kickoff of the container shipping contract negotiating season when carriers and their U.S. customers ranging from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) to mom and pop merchants and exporters of all stripes hammer out annual price and volume agreements.
Those closely watched, and often contentious, negotiations matter because the Asia-U.S. trade lane is the most lucrative for carriers, and those contracts set the tone for talks in other regions.
View 2 more stories 
Any shipper savings gleaned from those deals could come with a new headache though - late deliveries.
The Port of Los Angeles reported 17 canceled voyages in January and warned of more to come.
""If (carriers) keep bumping containers, we could end up missing Christmas,"" said Isaac Larian, chief executive of Southern California toy maker MGA Entertainment.
MGA's team has already switched around 75% of shipments of products like Rainbow High and L.O.L. Surprise! dolls to the short-term spot market from the long-term contract market. The company is paying around $1,150 per container - a cost savings of more than $18,000 from peak, Larian said.
Volatile spot rates were the first to plummet when pandemic-weary consumers shifted spending from goods to travel and entertainment. Now the gap between spot and contract rates is closing, pressured by the threat of recession and competition to fill ships, said Peter Sand, chief analyst at air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform Xeneta.
When demand was booming, carriers raked in record profits by focusing on the most lucrative cargo. Critical customers had to jostle for space and the likes of Walmart, Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Dollar Tree Inc (DLTR.O) chartered ships to keep shelves stocked.
But the tables have turned, and shippers want payback for ocean cargo costs that quadrupled in some cases.
It is ""shippers' revenge,"" said Jon Monroe, an industry consultant and North American representative of Singapore-based Transfar Shipping, whose investors include China e-commerce giant Alibaba (9988.HK).
""There was a time when everybody looked for a win-win. COVID threw that right off the tracks,"" he said.
Previously loyal customers are aggressively comparison- shopping, spreading their business around and gambling on the spot market, experts said.
The nonbinding nature of ocean contracts drives customers or carriers to push for everything they can get when leverage swings their way, said Lawrence Burns, a consultant who formerly handled negotiations for Hyundai Merchant Marine.
This time around, importer and exporter shipping managers, whose costs exploded when they were unexpectedly forced into the sky-high spot market, have the upper hand.
""They've been called into the CEO's office too many times in the last two years. They're coming back for blood,"" Burns said.
Asked if large customers are signing deals at near spot rates, MSC Vice President Allen Clifford said, ""I suppose some are."" Soren Toft, chief executive of the world's biggest carrier, declined to comment onstage at TPM23 on Monday.
Customers and carriers do not often discuss contract talks, but in recent earnings calls officials for Walmart - the No. 1 U.S. container shipper - furniture retailer La-Z-Boy (LZB.N), toy maker Mattel Inc (MAT.O) and musical instrument seller Yamaha said they expected to benefit from lower rates.

In his second letter to Illumina shareholders this week, Icahn wrote the ""only path forward is for Grail to be divested"".
Illumina said on Monday it will divest Grail, which it purchased in 2021, if it loses its appeal to the European Commission where regulators said last year they intend to require Illumina to unwind the $7.1 billion takeover.
The company did not have an immediate comment on Icahn's latest letter.
Icahn, who owns 1.4% of Illumina, launched a proxy fight earlier this week and is seeking three board seats at the company after weeks of private discussions with Illumina sputtered.
""We don't believe that it is possible for Illumina shareholders to receive the full value of GRAIL if Illumina pursues both the appeals process and the divestment process at the same time,"" Icahn wrote.

Speaking in an interview at the Reuters Impact conference, Managing Director Makhtar Diop said the current level of investment in emerging markets was just a fraction of the capital that could be being deployed from the world's markets.
To help accelerate efforts, the investment arm of the World Bank was helping to embed green finance in the broader financial system, improve regulations worldwide and help countries develop their own climate change transition plans, he said.
Even then, though, multi-lateral development banks (MDB) such as the World Bank needed to help create innovative financial structures that derisk projects for private sector investors.

Such ""blended finance"" can involve an MDB providing first loss-absorbing capital to help encourage more risk-averse funds and financiers to join in, thereby increasing the amount of money and amplifying the environmental impact.
""I believe that in the future, all activity related to climate change will be perceived as much less risky than it was in the past and the amount of blended finance that we will be bringing will be allowing us to leverage much more resources than we have been able to mobilise in the past,"" Diop said.
Diop's comments come several months after Larry Fink, the chief executive of the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock (BLK.N), urged an overhaul of the IFC and its peers to help encourage more private sector capital to move.  read more 
In response, Diop said MDBs were ""pushing as hard as they can"" and were fit for purpose, but acknowledged that they ""need to do more"", citing several projects under way that should help.
They include moving the climate change department to the core of the IFC's operations and helping investment officers to prepare ""bankable"" projects. The IFC was also working with peer MDBs to agree a shared methodology to assess projects, which should help drive more co-financing.
Close to $83 billion has so far been invested by the World Bank Group in activity related to climate change, Diop said, while in 2020 the World Bank Group invested a record $21 billion in climate-related projects.
""One third of our own resources are going to climate change related investment. We are trying to be, by 2025, Paris-aligned 100%, and by 2023 to be 85% Paris-aligned,"" he said, referring to the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate.
Looking ahead to the next round of global climate talks in Glasgow starting on Oct. 31, Diop said one of the biggest challenges would be scaling up the amount of money allocated to projects aimed at adapting to climate change.
The issue was ""the most difficult question that I'm facing today"", Diop said, given so many of the countries that need to adapt the most, for example because of coastal erosion or desertification, are in emerging markets.
""If there is one big question that I would like us to make progress (on) in COP26, this is one of them - how to channel more resources, collectively, for adaptation.""

Business,/business/tyson-foods-shut-two-us-chicken-plants-with-nearly-1700-workers-2023-03-14/,"Tyson Foods to shut two US chicken plants with nearly 1,700 workers",Tom Polansek,2023-03-14 20:20:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BK6OUTAYZFMRLFRLR3G7ATBZAQ.jpg,"CHICAGO, March 14 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) will close two U.S. chicken plants with almost 1,700 employees on May 12, the company said on Tuesday.
The closures show the biggest U.S. meat company by sales is still trying to figure out how to improve its chicken business that has struggled for years.
Tyson will shut a plant in Glen Allen, Virginia, with 692 employees and a plant in Van Buren, Arkansas, with 969 employees, according to a statement.
Chicken demand will shift to other plants as part of a strategy to utilize the full capacity at each of its facilities, the company said.
""The current scale and inability to economically improve operations has led to the difficult decision to close the facilities,"" Tyson said.
Arkansas-based Tyson said last year it could not fulfill all its orders for chicken due to limited supplies and labor, and planned to boost production. The company previously bought chicken from other producers to meet demand.

Tyson wrongly predicted last year that demand for chicken would be strong at supermarkets in November and December, Chief Executive Donnie King said on a quarterly earnings call last month. In January, the company replaced the president of its poultry business.
Shuttering plants is difficult but justified as Tyson seeks to improve performance, said Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. He said he was not surprised by the decision and expects Tyson may implement further restructuring.
""There's been a lot of investor pressure to management about improving the chicken margins,"" Sundaram said.
Tyson shares were slightly lower in afternoon trading.
Overall sales missed analyst estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 31, when total operating margins dropped to 3.5% from 11.3% a year earlier. The company at the time said the current quarter would be weaker than the end of 2022.
""They're desperate,"" said Magaly Licolli, director of Venceremos, an organization that advocates for poultry workers in Arkansas. ""They're trying to save money and cutting workers and making other workers do more.""
Tyson had about 124,000 U.S. employees as of Oct. 1, including 118,000 workers at non-corporate sites like meat plants, regulatory filings show. In October, the company said it would relocate all corporate employees to its headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas.
The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400 union, which represents employees at Tyson's plant in Virginia, slammed the decision to close the facility.
""These men and women risked their lives and the safety of their families to keep this plant operational during the pandemic, and this is the thanks they get?"" said Mark Federici, UFCW Local 400 president.
Tyson said workers losing their jobs could apply for positions at other company facilities.

Business,/business/finance/,Asia regulators move to shore up confidence as banking concerns mount,Lewis Jackson,2023-03-16 11:58:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/I6ZKIJFRYZJVHJXEAUIMU3QQIA.jpg,"SYDNEY/HONG KONG, March 16 (Reuters) - Asian policymakers and regulators sought to reassure investors on Thursday about the resilience of their banking systems and played down contagion risks after a crisis of confidence in the global banking sector triggered a market sell-off.
A plunge in shares of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) on Wednesday sparked fears of a full-blown banking crisis. The bank on Thursday announced it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.
The Credit Suisse development came a week after the collapse of a start-up lender in California.
Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers on Thursday said that local banks were well capitalised. He had convened a meeting this week between major regulators and the central bank after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
""Our regulators are on top of things, our banks well-capitalised with strong liquidity positions, but it's still a reminder of the risks, uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the global economy as interest rates rise,"" said Chalmers.

He made no mention of Credit Suisse, shares of which tanked by up 30% on Wednesday before it was given access to a liquidity lifeline by the Swiss National Bank (SNB).
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city's de facto central bank, said it had been monitoring developments in overseas financial markets and that it would ""maintain close dialogues with relevant overseas supervisory authorities"".
Responding to a Reuters query on the Credit Suisse stock collapse and wider market vulnerabilities, Hong Kong's securities watchdog said it was ""closely monitoring the situation to assess the impact"" on the city's market.
The Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong said it has ""maintained close dialogue with other financial regulators"" and the Hong Kong stock exchange on this matter.
The head of Japan's banking lobby, meanwhile, said there were no signs at the moment of the Japanese financial system being affected by a crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse, adding that the country's banks are well-capitalised.
In South Korea, the Financial Services Commission (FSC), said it was considering having its banks hold more capital to prepare for instability.
Its statement said it was considering raising the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) ratio from the current zero percent as early as the second half of this year.
The CCyB is designed to be adjusted to create buffers that strengthen the resilience of the banking sector during periods of stress.

Business,/business/energy/,EU plans subsidies for hydrogen made using renewable energy -draft document,Kate Abnett,2023-03-16 09:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QVIGJJHL4VOUFAPRO7SHAHDBQU.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission will outline plans on Thursday for a hydrogen subsidy scheme that would make clean versions of the fuel more competitive with fossil fuel-based hydrogen, a draft document showed.
EU industries use about 8 million tonnes of hydrogen, but the vast majority of that is produced using gas in a process that emits planet-heating CO2. The EU wants to switch to CO2-free hydrogen produced from renewable electricity to cut industry emissions.
The EU will launch a hydrogen funding ""bank"", consisting of auctions to award a fixed premium to hydrogen producers per kilogram of hydrogen for up to 10 years, according to a draft document seen by Reuters and which is due to be published on Thursday.
The first auction this year would offer around 800 million euros. The payments will be made once the hydrogen has been produced. To apply, projects would need proof that they have an interested buyer and a renewable energy supply to power the production site.

""The goal of the bank is to reduce the cost gap to a level that private off-takers are willing and able to cover,"" the draft said.
Governments will also be able to put national funding into the EU auctions to increase the budget for projects in their own countries, so that if projects miss out on the EU funding, they can still receive this state aid.
The EU wants to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen and import another 10 million by 2030. It currently produces less than 0.3 million tonnes of hydrogen from electricity, the draft said.
Hitting those targets would require massive investments to expand Europe's tiny fleet of electrolysers - the equipment used to produce hydrogen from electricity - and install 150 to 210 GW of new renewable energy capacity to power them.
That investment could cost up to 471 billion euros ($500 billion), the draft said - most of it expected to come from the private sector.

Business,/business/energy/,UAE's Fujairah needs to step up investments for new bunker fuels -execs,Jeslyn Lerh,2023-03-16 01:39:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YQQ7ZVFH3VIIFERD3ONQWIRYOI.jpg,"DUBAI, March 15 (Reuters) - UAE's Fujairah must step up investments for storage and supply of new alternative fuels as these markets are still lacking traction at the world's third-largest bunkering hub despite the urgency for maritime decarbonisation, industry executives said on Wednesday.
The maritime industry must seek out alternative fuels to meet carbon emission reduction targets set out by the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization, which include cutting carbon emissions by 40% from 2008 levels by 2030 and overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2050.
Despite being a key bunkering port, Fujairah has been lagging behind other hubs like Singapore and Rotterdam in gearing up for alternative fuel markets such as liquefied natural gas (LNG), biofuels and methanol.
Potential investments at Fujairah should involve repurposing tankage to accommodate these future fuels, said Law Say Huat, general manager at storage company Vopak Horizon Fujairah Terminals Ltd.

""There is a lot of development in terms of new energy, in terms of decarbonization in other hubs. We should not lose out in terms of that (at Fujairah),"" Law told the Fujairah Bunkering and Fuel Oil Forum (FUJCON) 2023 on Wednesday.
However, there are hurdles when it comes to stepping up these investments, including a lack of collaboration.
""Probably the thing that is really missing is the engagement amongst registered stakeholders,"" said Nizamuddin Noorali, general manager at storage terminal company GTI Fujairah.
""Everybody's doing their own bit and in a bit of isolation... there is no central engagement whereby the value chain can be added to the extent of terminals,"" Noorali added.
Lack of digitalisation and transparency will also hinder adoption.
""If you look at a bunker operation today on offshore Fujairah and the way that it's being measured, quantities are still done manually,"" TFG Marine's head of bunkering Kenneth Dam said on the forum's sidelines, adding that such manual operations are more time-consuming, and more prone to human error.
In contrast, top bunker hub Singapore has stepped up efforts in digitalising bunkering operations, which helps to pave the way for new fuels, he added.
Unlike Singapore, spot supplies for these fuels have been slow to take off at Fujairah due to a lack of immediate demand, trade sources said on the sidelines of the forum, though supplies will have to kick off in the coming years.
By 2050, methanol and LNG are expected to take the top market share of alternative bunker fuels at Fujairah, followed by biofuels and ammonia, showed results of an online poll at the FUJCON forum.
""I would hope that two years from now, when we are back here in Fujairah (for the next FUJCON), we are no longer just talking about being able to deliver LNG bunkers, but that we actually have the capability,"" industry coalition SEA-LNG's chairman Peter Keller told the forum.
Fujairah is poised to remain as one of the world's largest bunkering hubs. The port had a record year of oil-handling volumes in 2022 and is expected to register robust demand for storage going forward.

Business,/business/sustainable-business/,CNH Industrial buys UK's Bennamann to help farmers make energy from waste,Reuters,2023-03-15 17:52:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/Q5YCGAQQFRMLNEMDO3H5BMXVOY.jpg,"MILAN, March 15 (Reuters) - Italian-American CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) said on Wednesday it had taken a controlling stake in Bennamann, a UK-based developer of solutions to capture, repurpose and store methane emissions for energy use.
""This move boosts our leading position and portfolio in alternative fuels for the agriculture industry,"" the maker of farm machinery and construction equipment said in a statement, without providing financial details for the deal.
CNH, which started to cooperate with Bennamann in 2019, acquired a minority stake in the company in 2021 through its Ventures investment arm.
CNH's Venture head Michele Lombardi told Reuters the group's stake in Bennamann had been increased to just over 50% from a previous 10%. The deal was funded through readily available cash, he added.
Wednesday's announcement comes after CNH bought U.S. based partner Augmenta earlier this week, in a bid to boost its technology for crop spraying effectiveness.

Agriculture machines are CNH's largest business, accounting for around three quarters of the group's revenue last year.
Derek Neilson, president of agriculture at CNH Industrial, said the acquisition of Bennamann would help the group offer farmers ""a full energy production, storage and distribution service"".
""This solution can transform farms into mini energy hubs that can satisfy their own energy needs, produce their own natural fertilizer and sell any excess gas on the open market,"" he said.
The two companies have progressed beyond the prototype phase and plan to install their jointly developed solution on multiple farms over the next year, CNH said.
In a UK pilot, the partners captured emissions from livestock manure slurry which are then purified into biomethane that is subsequently either compressed or liquefied.
Both forms can be used as vehicle fuel, to generate electricity, and even supply household or farm power, while the byproducts can be used as a natural fertilizer.
According to research by CNH and Bennamann, a 120-cow farm operating their shared methane capture technology can reduce emissions of CO2 equivalent to 100 western European households, or about 780 tons annually.

Business,/business/energy/,EU power plan faces resistance as some seek deeper change,Kate Abnett,2023-03-15 15:39:00+00:00,,"BRUSSELS, March 15 (Reuters) - European Commission plans to revamp the bloc's electricity market brought relief to some, while disappointing countries that campaigned for more sweeping reforms they say are needed to protect against volatile fossil fuel prices.
The mixed response from countries sets the stage for tricky discussions between the 27 EU countries that must negotiate and approve the final reforms with European Parliament.
Diplomats from EU countries held a first discussion on Wednesday on the proposals outlined on Tuesday by the executive Commission. The aim is to increase the use of long-term power contracts that guarantee stable prices and weaken the link between consumers' bills and price swings on short-term energy markets.
For a group of countries, including Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, that had warned against major changes, Tuesday's announcement brought some relief.
View 2 more stories 
""The proposal sets the stage for a targeted reform with more limited adjustments than what has previously been discussed,"" Danish energy minister Lars Aagaard said.
Crucially for Denmark, and others wary of reform, the proposals leave intact the current EU system of setting power prices, whereby the market reflects the operating cost of the last power plant needed to meet demand.
That is often a gas plant, so gas price spikes can send electricity prices soaring, even when the much of the power is being produced from cheaper renewable sources.
Cuts to Russian gas supplies last year drove gas and power markets to record levels in Europe - prompting countries, including Austria and Greece, to urge Brussels to decouple gas prices from power.
Supporters of the existing system say market price signals help to prevent blackouts, as they allow price rises when supply is scarce, making consumers use less energy.
""A good market sends price signals,"" one official said, asking for anonymity.
The official said their capital was unlikely to accept the EU proposal that all future state support for new nuclear and renewable energy investments must take the form of a ""contract for difference"" - a type of fixed-price contract between a power plant and the state.
France, which plans to build new nuclear power plants and upgrade its existing fleet, welcomed the reforms, which French energy minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said would encourage investment in nuclear energy.
Spain was also supportive.
""We consider it positive that the Commission has assumed Spain's proposal to strengthen the role of long-term and capacity contracts as its own,"" a Spanish government official said, referring to proposals Spain made in January to expand Europe's use of contracts for difference.
Reform-hungry countries, meanwhile, were unhappy.
""Last year, we repeatedly called on the Commission to ensure that high gas prices in Europe do not automatically drive up electricity prices. So far, it has failed to provide a solution to this,"" Austrian Climate Minister Leonore Gewessler said.

Britain has a target to close its coal-fired power plants by October 2024 as part of efforts to cut fossil fuel emissions in line with global climate goals that seek to mitigate the effects of catastrophic climate change.
Plant operators such as EDF (EDF.PA) and Drax (DRX.L) had indicated their plants would close before this deadline, but they have been kept available under contracts with National Grid as part of contingency plans for winter 2022/23 against a backdrop of record gas prices and fears of supply issues.
National Grid's Electricity System Operator said it had been asked by the government to explore potential contingency contracts for coal plants for the 2023/24 winter.

This winter the back-up coal plants have been used only once, when a cold snap swept the country in early March.
But both EDF and Drax said they did not expect to be able keep their plants ready for operation again next winter.
EDF said it had already indicated to the government that it planned to close its two remaining coal units at the West Burton A plant on March 31, 2023.
“There are a number of workforce and operational reasons that mean extending the life of West Burton A again is very challenging,"" it said in a statement, adding that many staff have already stayed on well beyond planned retirement dates.
Drax also said its coal units will close at the end of March 2023 as planned.
With ""a number of certifications expiring on the coal-fired units, the units would not be able to operate compliantly for winter 2023,"" a Drax spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Uniper (UN01.DE), which operates the Ratcliffe coal power plant said as its four units already have separate capacity market contracts they would not be eligible for a new contingency contract.
Britain has a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

Business,/business/energy/,"EU to revamp power market, aiming to blunt price spikes",Kate Abnett,2023-03-14 13:32:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/UDY37H2FEBLKRKDNALM7HIZ67Q.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission is set to propose a revamp of Europe's electricity market rules on Tuesday, aimed at expanding the use of fixed-price power contracts to shield consumers from severe price spikes like those experienced last year.
The European Union vowed to overhaul its electricity market after cuts to Russian gas after its invasion of Ukraine last year sent European power prices soaring to record highs, forcing industries to close and hiking households' bills.
Draft versions of the EU proposal, seen by Reuters, outline measures designed to make consumers less exposed to short-term swings in fossil fuel prices - by nudging countries to use more contracts that lock in stable, long-term electricity prices.
Future state support for new investments in wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and nuclear electricity, for example, must be done through a two-way contract for difference (CfD).
View 2 more stories 
Two-way CfDs offer generators a fixed ""strike price"" for their electricity, regardless of the price in short-term energy markets.
Countries would also need to do more to encourage power purchase agreements (PPA) - another type of long-term contract to directly buy electricity from a generator - such as by providing state guarantees for such contracts.
Fossil fuel-powered generators would not receive this support. The aim is to direct support towards the huge investments in renewable energy EU countries need to quit Russian fossil fuels and meet climate change goals.
Other elements aim to push gas out of Europe's energy mix faster - for example, by requiring countries to expand energy storage and other alternatives to replace the role gas plants play in balancing the power grid.
Currently, power prices in Europe are set by the final generator needed to meet overall demand. Often, that is a gas plant, so gas price spikes - like those caused last year by Russia slashing gas deliveries - can send electricity prices soaring.
Despite Brussels pitching the reforms last year as a chance to ""decouple"" gas and power prices, the draft proposal - which could still change before it is published - avoids the deep electricity market reform that countries, including Spain and France, have called for, opting instead for more limited tweaks to stabilise prices.
Another camp of countries, including Germany, Denmark and Latvia, have warned major changes could scare off investors.
EU countries and the European Parliament must negotiate and approve the final rules, with some pushing for a deal by the end of the year.
Marco Foresti, market design manager at the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E), said the draft proposals had been met with ""a bit of a sigh of relief"" among those concerned about disrupting the functioning of short-term energy markets.

Business,/business/energy/,Biden administration approves massive Willow oil project in Alaska,Nichola Groom,2023-03-13 22:58:00+00:00,,"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is approving a scaled-back version of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) $7 billion oil and gas drilling Willow project in Alaska, the U.S. Department of Interior said on Monday, drawing cheers from Alaskan officials and the oil industry but criticism from environmental advocates.
The decision follows an aggressive eleventh-hour campaign from opponents who had argued the development of the three drill sites in northwestern Alaska conflicts with President Joe Biden's highly publicized efforts to fight climate change and shift to cleaner sources of energy.
Alaska's elected officials say the project will create hundreds of jobs and bring billions of dollars in revenue to state and federal coffers. The state relies heavily on revenue from oil production, but output there has declined dramatically from its peak in the 1980s.
""I feel the people of Alaska have been heard,"" U.S. Representative Mary Peltola, a Democrat from Alaska, said on a call with reporters. ""The state of Alaska cannot carry the burden of solving our global warming issues alone.""

The fate of the project has been closely watched as Biden seeks to balance his goals of decarbonizing the U.S. economy and restoring U.S. leadership on climate change while also increasing domestic fuel supplies to keep prices low.
The United Nations, which has urged nations to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, criticized the move.
""These are not projects that move us in the right direction,"" spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters when asked about the Willow approval.
The Interior Department approved the project with three drill pads after saying last month it was concerned about the greenhouse gas impacts of Willow. ConocoPhillips had sought to build up to five drill sites and project infrastructure including dozens of miles of roads and pipelines and seven bridges.

The agency said the smaller scope will reduce the impact on habitats for species like polar bears and yellow-billed loons.
The administration also announced late on Sunday sweeping new protections for undisturbed Alaskan lands and waters that would keep nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean ""indefinitely off limits"" for oil and gas leasing, effectively closing off U.S. Arctic waters to oil exploration. It also issued protections for 13 million acres of ""ecologically sensitive"" special areas within Alaska's petroleum reserve.
Environmental groups, however, criticized the Biden administration, saying it was trying to have it ""both ways"" on climate change.
""Promoting clean energy development is meaningless if we continue to allow corporations to plunder and pollute as they wish,” Food & Water Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter said.
Green groups have said they would challenge Willow in court. U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska said the congressional delegation is expecting an imminent legal challenge and is preparing an amicus brief to defend the project.

Business,/business/energy/,BP recommends vote against climate activist resolution at April 27 AGM,Reuters,2023-03-13 16:12:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QAZLDCN3LFO65N4V27UIE7LXKU.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - BP's (BP.L) board recommended on Monday that shareholders vote against a climate activist resolution asking for more emissions cuts by 2030 at its April 27 shareholder meeting.
Activist group Follow This said in December it had co-filed resolutions with six major institutional investors managing $1.3 trillion in assets ahead of the annual general meetings of BP, Chevron (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Shell (SHEL.L).
Follow This wants the companies to commit to absolute emissions cuts by 2030 in line with the Paris climate deal, including emissions from the combustion of the fuels they sell, known as Scope 3 emissions.
BP called the Follow This resolution ""unclear"", ""simplistic"" and ""disruptive"" and said it encroached on the board's responsibility to set the firm's strategy.
Scientists say the world needs to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, to have any hope of meeting Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

BP rowed back on plans to slash oil and gas output and emissions last month. It now aims to produce 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2030, down just 25% from 2019 levels compared with previous plans for a 40% cut.
As a result, BP reduced its ambitions to cut emissions from fuels sold to customers to 20%-30% by 2030, from 35%-40%.
""BP’s reversal was a wake-up call for institutional investors, asset managers and pension funds,"" said Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This.
""Paris-aligned voting has to regain momentum in 2023.""
Last year, shareholder support for Follow This' resolution fell to around 15% of BP shareholders from around 21% the previous year.
Two of the UK's largest pension schemes will vote against the renewal of top directors at BP and Shell (SHEL.L) unless both companies strengthen commitments to tackling carbon emissions, the Financial Times reported.
The Follow This resolution needs 75% of votes to pass. BP said its board did not consider the activist resolution to be in the company's or its shareholders' best interests.

The Rovigo liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal is owned by Exxon's subsidiary ExxonMobil Italiana Gas (70.7%), QatarEnergy subsidiary Qatar Terminal Company Limited (22%) and Snam Spa (SRG.MI) (7.3%).
Snam, an Italian gas grid operator, has the first right of refusal should a partner decide to divest.
Exxon said that while it was verifying market interest, it had not made a decision about a potential sale and has not identified a buyer at this early stage.
""Tests like this are consistent with our focused investment strategy, highlighting our willingness to divest noncore assets to those who can derive greater value,"" Exxon spokesperson Meghan Macdonald said.

The offshore terminal, managed by Italy's Terminale GNL Adriatico, is located in the northern Adriatic Sea, about 15 km off Porto Viro in the Veneto region. The facility has recently had its regasification capacity expanded to 9 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year.
Any transaction would not impact Exxon's imports of LNG into the Adriatic LNG terminal, or affect its interest in the Italian and European markets as a natural gas supplier, the company said.

Siemens Energy in November launched a bid for the remaining stake it did not already own in Siemens Gamesa, frustrated by a number of profit warnings at the division that had become a problem for its parent as well.
To help fund the 4.05 billion euro bid, Siemens Energy sold around 72.7 million new shares to institutional investors at 17.32 euros apiece, it said, equating to a discount of 5% to Wednesday's closing price.
Siemens Energy shares were up 1.8% following the share sale on Thursday.
""We are very pleased to see that institutional investors, amongst others ... are confident in our strategy to become the leader in the energy transition,"" Siemens Energy Chief Financial Officer Maria Ferraro said.
""The capital increase was almost four times covered. The successful placement of new shares is an important milestone in the refinancing of our cash tender offer for Siemens Gamesa and supports our solid investment grade credit rating,"" she added.

A spokesperson for Siemens Energy said that BNP Paribas Energy Transition Fund (BNPP.PA) had subscribed to around 10% of the new shares, translating into a stake of 0.9% in Siemens Energy.
Major shareholder Siemens (SIEGn.DE), which has repeatedly ruled out investing further capital in Siemens Energy, said its direct stake was diluted to 32% from 35%.
The share sale means that Siemens Energy's share capital will be increased by 10% through the issuing of the new shares, which carry full dividend rights for the current fiscal year.
Citigroup (C.N) and SocGen (SOGN.PA) acted as joint global coordinators on the deal alongside joint bookrunners UniCredit in cooperation with Kepler Cheuvreux and HSBC.

""Yes, we are still in the process,"" Becker said in an interview without giving details.
U.S. banking giant Citigroup is offloading its Mexican retail unit, also known locally as Banamex, as part of Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser's efforts to simplify the firm.
Mifel is battling billionaire German Larrea's conglomerate Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX), which has secured a $5 billion debt package for its proposed Banamex acquisition, people familiar with the matter said last month.
Larrea emerged as the front-runner to buy Banamex over Mifel's Becker, the sources said at the time.
Other potential buyers have included fellow Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and Spanish bank Santander, who also showed interest in Banamex but have since dropped out of the race.

Business,/business/finance/,"No pressure to raise interest rates on deposits, UniCredit CEO says",Valentina Za,2023-03-15 13:23:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7AASFVVIKNJX3DIXBAA3BGYWYM.jpg,"MILAN, March 15 (Reuters) - UniCredit (CRDI.MI) is not under pressure to raise the interest rates it pays on retail deposits, which account for about 60% of its deposit base and are ""very sticky"", Chief Executive Andrea Orcel said on Wednesday.
Addressing a Morgan Stanley banking conference in London, Orcel generally dismissed concerns about European banks after the failures of U.S. peers Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.
""Most banks have liquidity ratios that are off the charts,"" he said, adding that the European Central Bank would only be forced to intervene in case of a ""dramatic dislocation"" which at present there is no reason to fear.
A stable deposit base is widely seen as one of the bulwarks protecting European banks from the issues faced by the two failed U.S. lenders.
Large European banks, Orcel said, ""have been holding the line"" on 'deposit betas', meaning the percentage of interest rate rises that are passed on to customers as the ECB increases the cost of credit.
View 2 more stories 
In answer to a question on the fallout from the SVB crisis, Orcel said the bank faced ""absolutely no pressure"" to shift its stance regarding retail deposits.
It has, however, already passed higher rates on to corporate clients and will continue to do so this year.
""The impact we've had from corporate has already bled through and we are anticipating the final bleed ... this year. And the rest is very, very, very stable,"" he said.
""Now people are probably more worried about making sure that [money]'s there and safe"" rather than seeking higher rates by moving their current account, he said.
Orcel's comments echoed those of Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) Finance Chief Stefano Del Punta who on Tuesday told the same conference that Intesa was not repricing retail deposits, but offered instead money market products.
Like UniCredit, Intesa differentiates between retail and corporate clients and it is paying the Euribor rate to its main large corporate clients after charging them a negative 50 basis points on their deposits in past years.

Business,/business/finance/,Crown Agents Bank owner explores sale of British payments group –sources,Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro,2023-03-15 06:07:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/3UW7QABRRVPGRE5ZB4MRZ66HC4.jpg,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Helios Investment Partners has been working with advisers to sell a stake in Crown Agents Bank, a British provider of cross-border payments, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The private equity investor has engaged Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and JPMorgan & Co (JPM.N) to explore strategic options, including a private sale and a domestic float, said the sources, who asked not to be named discussing private information.
Helios had been preparing to list Crown Agents Bank's shares as soon as next quarter, in what would be Britain's first major initial public offering (IPO) since Ithaca Energy (ITH.L) in November, one source said.
But the timing of a float remains open, another source said, after the collapse of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank last week sent jitters across equity markets.
Meanwhile, banks are sounding out buyers as an alternative to a listing, with indicative offers expected in the coming weeks, one source said.
View 2 more stories 
Spokespeople for Barclays and Helios declined to comment. Spokespeople for Crown Agents Bank and JPMorgan did not return requests for comment.
Sources disagreed on the potential price tag for Crown Agents Bank, with two of them placing it at up to 800 million pounds ($973.68 million) and another at well above 1 billion pounds.
However, they concurred that its valuation would be informed by that of British payments giant Wise (WISEa.L).
Shares in Wise have slid more than 40% since the group's landmark direct listing in 2021 and are down almost 3% this year amid market turbulence.
It trades at about 45 times its earnings for the last 12 months and 26 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), including debt.
Crown Agents Bank, which focuses on emerging markets, posted operating income for 2021 of 53 million pounds, up from 33 million the year prior, along with a twelvefold increase in profits to close to 9 million pounds. Its EBITDA stood at 16 million pounds.
The explorations come after IPO levels in London plunged by roughly 90% last year and global merger and acquisitions (M&A)activity contracted on the back of rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.
A float would come as a win for London, where local technology companies have been looking overseas for a potential IPO home.

Business,/business/finance/,First Republic spoke to private equity before securing financing -sources,Reuters,2023-03-15 12:59:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - First Republic Bank (FRC.N) spoke to at least one private equity firm about raising capital before it secured financing from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and U.S. authorities intervened with support for the industry, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The conversations, which have not been previously reported, shed new light on the frenzied activity that took place over the weekend after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, as other lenders under pressure looked for ways to restore investor confidence.
First Republic had various approaches and ideas put to it, a third source familiar with the matter said, adding that private equity firms have capital to deploy and were looking for opportunities.
They added that the private equity deal talks ended once First Republic announced its credit line with JPMorgan.
First Republic was not immediately available for comment.
The approach came prior to the U.S. Federal Reserve and other regulators on Sunday evening announced a series of emergency measures to shore up confidence in the banking system, which took away some of the urgency to do a deal, the sources said.
View 2 more stories 
First Republic said on Sunday night it had secured additional financing through JPMorgan, giving it access to a total of $70 billion in funds through various sources. The additional borrowing capacity from the Fed as well as that from JPMorgan had boosted the amount of liquidity it had available.
JPMorgan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Shares of First Republic slumped more than 60% on Monday on fears of bank contagion following the collapse of SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O). SVB had seen flight of deposits, many of which were uninsured. First Republic's shares recovered a part of their losses on Tuesday, rising 27%.
One of the sources said other banks, too, had looked for capital but after the administration's emergency measures on Sunday and a rout in bank stocks the following day, any deals would likely take time.
In some cases, the situation had flipped from banks looking for capital to investors seeking bargains, one of the sources said.
Founded in 1985, First Republic had $212 billion in assets and $176.4 billion in deposits as of the end of last year, according to its annual report.
About 70% of its deposits are uninsured, above the median of 55% for medium-sized banks and the third highest in the group after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according to a Bank of America note.
The White House on Tuesday weighed in, with an official saying it is carefully monitoring developments at First Republic and other smaller banks after actions to protect depositors.
The official said the U.S. banking system was in ""a vastly better position right now"" than if the actions had not been taken and depositors should have confidence their funds would be protected.

Business,/business/finance/,"Charles Schwab CEO says firm has liquidity, not seeking capital or deals",Lananh Nguyen,2023-03-15 02:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FXJCIBRJVBKVTOXMBS7B6Q5LHA.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Charles Schwab (SCHW.N) has ample liquidity, the chief executive of the bank and brokerage said on Tuesday, moving to allay concerns about a ""doomsday scenario"" that has weighed broadly on bank stocks after the failure of two U.S. lenders since Friday.
""We have not raised capital and we are not in the market at this point for M&A transactions,"" Walt Bettinger, CEO of Charles Schwab, told Reuters in an interview.
The firm had seen an influx of $4 billion in assets to its parent company on Friday as clients moved assets to Schwab from other firms, Bettinger said.
Schwab on Monday reported that total client assets had slid to $7.38 trillion in February, down 4% compared with a year ago.
Bettinger said Schwab was comfortable with the assets on its bank portfolio, which is separate from its brokerage business. He contrasted it with the portfolios of other companies that had run into trouble.
View 2 more stories 
""Our available for-sale portfolio is short in duration and high in quality, and our held-to-maturity is slightly longer in duration but still short compared to many people, and very high-quality,"" said Bettinger, who has led Schwab since the 2008 financial crisis.
Banks can classify bonds as ""held-to-maturity"" (HTM) and are not required to count changes in value if the securities are kept until they are repaid, or they can keep the bonds as ""available-for-sale"" (AFS), which means they must count unrealized losses against capital, but are free to sell the securities at any time.
Schwab's shares closed 9.2% higher at $56.68 on Tuesday, along with a broad rise in bank stocks. But Schwab shares are still down 25.6% from their close last Wednesday, the day before many bank shares began a downward spiral in reaction to problems at Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O). Regulators shut SVB on Friday.
The banking collapse has roiled global markets. Even though fears of a contagion have eased, concerns remain. The S&P 500 regional banks index (.SPLRCBNKS) is down 26% over the past five sessions.  read more 
""I appreciate and understand the doomsday scenario but I also think getting the facts out is very important - that our clients are not reacting in the manner that the doomsday scenario would indicate,"" Bettinger said.
Richard Repetto, a managing director at Piper Sandler, said that, compared with many regional banks that have come under pressure in the last week, Schwab had higher unrealized securities portfolio losses relative to its capital levels.
""That said, due to robust supplemental liquidity sources, we think it is very unlikely that SCHW (Schwab) will ever need to sell HTM securities to meet deposit withdrawal requests,"" with $150 billion to $200 billion of available liquidity, he said in a note to clients on Monday.
Downward pressure on Schwab's stock eased after Bettinger told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that he had bought 50,000 Schwab shares, while billionaire investor Ron Baron said he had ""modestly increased"" his position in Schwab.
About 82% of deposits held by Schwab were insured, falling under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's limit of $250,000.
The bank said on Monday it had ""access to significant liquidity"", including an estimated $100 billion of cash flow from cash on hand, portfolio-related cash flows, plus new assets.

Skoda, the leader of a Czech car sector that is the backbone of the country's industrial output, has seen its Russian operation hit hard by the disruptions caused by the war and by Western sanctions imposed on Russia.
The carmaker said on Thursday its net profit dropped 11.7% to 489 million euros in 2022, affected also by a steep rise in material prices and global supply chain bottlenecks.
Skoda's deliveries in Russia plummeted to 18,300 cars in 2022 from 90,400 in 2021, when the country was Skoda's second-largest market.
""The talks (on the sale) are in the final stages, but I can't give you details until they are agreed by all parties,"" Chief Executive Klaus Zellmer told an annual press conference streamed online.

He said Skoda aimed to replace lost Russian production at its other plants around the globe.
Volkswagen brand chief executive Thomas Schaefer made similar comments on Thursday.
On prospects for this year, Skoda board member for sales, Martin Jahn, said production and sales should exceed last year, when global deliveries dropped to 731,300 cars.
This should be helped in part by Skoda's upcoming entry into the Vietnamese market, where it will start selling its cars in the second quarter. Jahn estimated the initial potential at 30,000 cars.
Skoda will also take over strategic management of Volkswagen's expansion in South East Asia.

A plunge in shares of Credit Suisse has renewed fears of a full-blown banking crisis, causing a rout in global bank shares. Credit Suisse later announced it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.
""Global banks have beefed up their risk controls over capital and liquidity"" since the 2008 global financial crisis, Junichi Hanzawa, chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association, told reporters.
""European banks generally have solid capital ratios, and so do Japanese banks,"" said Hanzawa, also the chief executive of MUFG Bank (8306.T).
He also said systemic risks from the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank have been reduced since the Federal Reserve's decision to backstop all depositors.

Losses in Silicon Valley Bank's bond portfolio have highlighted similar risks for Japanese lenders' gigantic foreign bond holdings and their relatively low loan-to-deposit ratios.
Hanzawa assured of the health of the Japanese banking sector, saying that major banks have hedged their positions in foreign bonds and regional banks have already sold substantial amounts of them.
But he warned that the Silicon Valley Bank case showed that a bank run and a subsequent collapse can happen in a matter of a few days even when risk management at banks has been improved.
He also said the environment surrounding the financial market is changing drastically due to inflation, interest rate movements and geopolitical risks.
""We need to closely monitor economic and market situations including credit costs at individual banks,"" he said.

Credit Suisse has a 1.5% share among foreign banks' assets in India and a 'small' 0.1% share of overall banking assets in the country, Jefferies estimated. It has only 1 branch in India and total assets of over 200 billion rupees ($2.42 billion), it said.
""Given the relevance of Credit Suisse to India's banking sector, we see softer adjustments in assessment of counter-party risks, especially in the derivative market,"" analysts Prakhar Sharma and Vinayak Agarwal said in a note.
Earlier in the day, Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) said it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence after a slump in its shares intensified fears about a global banking crisis.

Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank, is the first major global bank to be given an emergency lifeline since the 2008 financial crisis and its problems have raised serious doubts over whether central banks will be able to sustain their fight against inflation with aggressive interest rate hikes.
Those fears have roiled financial markets globally as well as in India.
Jefferies said it would watch out for liquidity issues and any rub-off on counter-party risk assessment on Indian banks, especially in derivatives.
The brokerage expects the Reserve Bank of India to keep a close watch on liquidity issues and counter-party exposures, and intervene if necessary.
This may also lead to institutional deposits moving more towards larger or quality banks, Jefferies said.

Business,/business/finance/,French insurer AXA outlines bond exposure to SVB and US regional banks,Reuters,2023-03-16 07:03:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IUH3EOA2DNPVNIZYPX72EMQFGI.jpg,"PARIS, March 16 (Reuters) - French insurer AXA (AXAF.PA) has a relatively small corporate bond exposure to Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O), group Deputy CEO Frederic de Courtois told a Morgan Stanley investor conference this week.
""On direct impact, we have 66 million corporate bond exposure to SVB. I would qualify this as an immaterial impact for us. On regional banks of the size and the type of SVB, the lightly regulated regional banks, we have about 300 million exposure on corporate bonds,"" he said.

Business,/business/finance/,"Analysis: For Goldman Sachs, SVB's botched stock sale had a silver lining",Echo Wang,2023-03-16 05:10:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SFSAO55F3BNIJFBGBQX2QB34CI.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - As SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) wrestled with a capital shortfall and the prospect of a downgrade to its credit rating last week, it went to Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and worked out an unusual two-part plan, according to people familiar with the discussions.
The investment bank would buy a $21.5 billion bond portfolio from SVB to boost its coffers, after startups began pulling their deposits from the technology-focused lender, which does business as Silicon Valley Bank.
But there was a hitch. Goldman's offer for the portfolio was worth $1.8 billion less than the book value SVB had assigned to it, because a rise in interest rates had made it less valuable. SVB would have to book a loss on the portfolio, which comprised U.S. Treasuries and related bonds.
The next step was for Goldman to put together a solution. It would help organize a $2.25 billion stock sale for SVB to fill the funding gap caused by the bond portfolio sale, two of the sources said.

Goldman delivered on only the first step of that plan. Once the bond portfolio deal was completed, the storied investment bank didn't have time to convince investors to lock in capital and overcome concerns about depositors pulling money out of SVB.
The tight turnaround left insufficient time to prepare materials for investors by early last week, one of the sources said. The stock sale collapsed and SVB became the largest U.S. bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis, fueling concern about other lenders and prompting regulatory interventions to backstop customer deposits.
Yet for Goldman, the botched deal had a silver lining. The bond portfolio it acquired from SVB is now worth more, based on the drop in Treasury yields since the transaction happened. Traders not affiliated with the deal that were interviewed by Reuters estimated the gain in value to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. A source familiar with details of a hedge that Goldman's trading desk put on the deal said the gain would be less than $100 million.
It is unclear whether Goldman has held onto all or part of the bond portfolio or sold it. Goldman declined to comment. SVB did not respond to a request for comment. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday, SVB said its bond portfolio sales to Goldman were done at ""negotiated prices"".
Goldman was not paid the underwriting fee it had agreed for the stock sale because that deal fell through, two of the sources said. SVB has not disclosed how much that fee would have been.
Details provided by six people familiar with the attempted capital raise show that Goldman and SVB underestimated the challenges of pulling off the capital raise in terms of timing and investor interest. Only two private equity firms were ultimately invited to participate in the capital raise last week - General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus. SVB and Goldman hoped stock market investors would chip in for the remainder, four of the sources said.
Warburg Pincus turned down the deal, however, because it needed more time to carry out due diligence after it became concerned that SVB could still face long-term funding issues, two of the sources said. General Atlantic pledged $500 million, but walked away when the capital raise fell through.
Warburg Pincus and General Atlantic declined to comment.
The banks also miscalculated how investors would react to the stock sale. One of the sources said the company believed that investors would welcome the plan as a boon to SVB's financial health, but it backfired and instead sent a worrying signal that triggered a 60% plunge in the bank's shares. The mood of investors was already tense after another bank advised by Goldman, cryptocurrency-focused bank Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N), collapsed the day before.
The handling of the SVB deal by Goldman, the most prolific dealmaker based on league table data, has attracted Wall Street's fascination and invited scrutiny.
Michael Ohlrogge, associate professor at the New York University School of Law, said that while Goldman may not have handled everything ""exactly right"", it had taken on a difficult assignment to begin with. ""(SVB) had gotten themselves into such a risky position,"" Ohlrogge said.
SVB did not disclose in its stock sale prospectus to investors that Goldman was the acquirer of the bond portfolio it sold at a loss. But in the prospectus, SVB did mention other relationships and potential conflicts of interest, such as SVB's investment banking arm underwriting the deal.
SVB disclosed Goldman's role as acquirer of the bond portfolio only on Tuesday, the last day of a four-business day window that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) affords companies to make such disclosures. Five securities lawyers interviewed by Reuters said that SVB's handling of the disclosure appeared to comply with the rules.
An SEC spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.

Business,/business/finance/,Credit Suisse intends to borrow up to 50 bln Swiss francs from Swiss National Bank,Reuters,2023-03-16 02:24:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LEXKEKNYXVM45DL245A65HJ7NM.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) said on Thursday it intended to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank in what it called ""decisive action"" to boost its liquidity.
The planned move came after Swiss regulators pledged a liquidity lifeline to Credit Suisse in an unprecedented move by a central bank after the flagship Swiss lender's shares fell by as much as 30% on Wednesday.
""Credit Suisse is taking decisive action to pre-emptively strengthen its liquidity by intending to exercise its option to borrow from the Swiss National Bank (SNB) up to CHF 50 billion under a Covered Loan Facility as well as a short-term liquidity facility, which are fully collateralized by high quality assets,"" Credit Suisse said in a statement.
It pointed to its end-2022 Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.1% and average liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 144%. The latter had improved to about 150% by March 14, it said.

Referring to the intended borrowing, it said: ""This additional liquidity would support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs.""
The collapses in the U.S. of Silicon Valley Bank last week and Signature Bank two days later have sent global bank stocks on a rollercoaster ride.
Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Bank, said investors might be worried about Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse for different reasons, but both suffered from the side effect of high-interest rates.
""The underlying economic stress may emerge more frequently ... and it is possible to see more black swans in an uncertain environment,"" he said.
The Swiss lender's latest move came after CEO Ulrich Koerner said in an interview earlier on Wednesday that the bank's ""capital, our liquidity basis is very very strong.""
""We fulfill and overshoot basically all regulatory requirements.""
Credit Suisse Group last month reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 global financial crisis after rattled clients pulled billions of dollars from the bank. It warned that a further ""substantial"" loss would come this year.
The bank, Switzerland's second biggest, has begun a major overhaul of its business, cutting costs and jobs to revive its fortunes, including creating a separate business for its investment bank under the CS First Boston brand. The bank raised 4 billion Swiss francs from investors in December.
On Wednesday, it also announced offers for senior debt securities for cash of up to 3 billion francs.
The bank said it had also accelerated cost cuts and was well on track to deliver 2.5 billion francs of cost-base reductions by 2025, including 1.2 billion francs in 2023.

Credit Suisse leaders and government officials have talked about options that range from a public statement of support to a potential liquidity backstop, the reportsaid.
Other suggested potential moves for Credit Suisse could be a potential separation of their Swiss unit and a tie-up with their larger Swiss competitor, UBS Group AG (UBSG.S), the report said, adding that it's unclear which, if any of these steps will actually be executed.
Switzerland is under pressure from at least one major government to intervene quickly on Credit Suisse, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters, after the Swiss bank led a rout of European bank stocks on Wednesday.
Credit Suisse shares dropped by as much as 30.8%, leading a 7% fall in the European banking index .SX7P, while five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for the flagship Swiss bank hit a new record high, reviving fears of a broader threat to the financial system.

Business,/business/finance/,Bain Capital's Connaughton says SVB fallout will weigh on banks,Chibuike Oguh,2023-03-15 22:09:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - Bain Capital's co-managing partner, John Connaughton, told Reuters on Wednesday that the fallout from SVB Financial Group's (SIVB.O) collapse will weigh on banks that have already retrenched from lending.
Connaughton said private equity firms like Bain have been turning to peers with direct lending arms to secure debt for deals because traditional bank financing has become scarcer as banks adjust to the quick rise in interest rates. This is despite debt from direct lenders being significantly more expensive than bank financing.
While the banking sector is strong enough to withstand SVB's failure, the lender's collapse will add to the caution that banks have been showing, Connaughton said in a Reuters Newsmaker interview.
""The questions that are getting raised about Silicon Valley Bank are, 'Where is the liability and asset matching ... Where does that all sit and what liquidity concerns are out there?'"" Connaughton said.
Connaughton said the cost of typical debt financing for private equity firms doing deals had jumped from between 5% and 6% to between 8% and 10%, while equity checks had also jumped.
View 2 more stories 
He added that Bain's return expectations on deals remained the same, partly because earnings at its portfolio of companies grew by 15% last year.
""Unlike the public market, which increasingly paid a higher and higher price, we did pay some higher prices, but when we underwrote a deal, we underwrote it to a five-year plan where exit multiples will normalize,"" Connaughton said.
Founded in 1984, Boston-based Bain Capital has grown into one of the world's largest investment firms with more than $160 billion in assets under management spread across private equity, credit, real estate, venture capital, life sciences and cryptocurrency and blockchain investments.

Business,/business/finance/,SVB failure offers lesson for China - state media,Reuters,2023-03-15 01:49:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AUYEJEWAWZIGBFMAJQQKUG7UQQ.jpg,"SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, March 15 (Reuters) - The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) will not impact China's financial system but offers an important lesson for the country's banking industry, the official Securities Times said in an editorial on Wednesday.
An SVB-style bank failure is unlikely to happen in China but the incident would have ""important implications for the development of China's small- and medium-sized lenders, and the stability of China's financial system,"" the editorial said.
SVB's shutdown on Friday has roiled global markets, forced U.S. President Joe Biden to rush out assurances that the financial system is safe and prompted emergency U.S. measures giving banks access to more funding.
In China, shares of smaller lenders including Bank of Lanzhou (001227.SZ), Xi An Bank (600928.SS) and Xiamen Bank (601187.SS) have far underperformed big banks over the past week, amid concerns over their ability to manage risks.

China's smaller banks, more vulnerable to interest rate risks, could suffer from shrinking interest spreads and investment losses during a rate hike cycle, GF Securities said in a report this week.
The Securities Times said that while the SVB incident reflects loosened regulation of such banks in the U.S., a slew of financial regulatory reforms in China over the past years have cleaned up the industry, curbed shadow banking and reduced financial risks.
In addition, China has been closing regulatory loopholes, the editorial said. In the latest move, China said last week it would set up a new national financial regulatory body consolidating oversight of the industry.
""Although the SVB incident won't have material impact on China's finiancial markets, China's financial industry still needs to earnestly learn from this lesson, and always prioritise risk prevention and control,"" the newspaper said.
SVB's (SIVB.O) China joint venture has also sought to ease fears among clients and investors, saying on Saturday it has a sound corporate structure and an independently operated balance sheet.

Business,/business/finance/,SVB is largest bank failure since 2008 financial crisis,David French,2023-03-11 16:54:00+00:00,,"March 10 (Reuters) - Startup-focused lender SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday, in a sudden collapse that roiled global markets, left billions of dollars belonging to companies and investors stranded.
California banking regulators closed the bank, which did business as Silicon Valley Bank, on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for later disposition of its assets.
Based in Santa Clara, the lender was ranked as the 16th biggest in the U.S. at the end of last year, with about $209 billion in assets. Specifics of the tech-focused bank's abrupt collapse were a jumble, but the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes in the last year, which had crimped financial conditions in the start-up space in which it was a notable player, seemed front and center.
As it tried to raise capital to offset fleeing deposits, the bank lost $1.8 billion on Treasury bonds whose values were torpedoed by the Fed rate hikes.

Silicon Valley Bank's failure is the largest since Washington Mutual went bust in 2008, a hallmark event that triggered a financial crisis that hobbled the economy for years. The 2008 crash prompted tougher rules in the United States and beyond.
Since then, regulators have imposed more stringent capital requirements for U.S. banks aimed at ensuring individual bank collapses won't harm the wider financial system and economy.
The main office and all branches of Silicon Valley Bank will reopen on March 13 and all insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, the FDICsaid.
But 89% of the bank's $175 billion in deposits were uninsured as the end of 2022, according to the FDIC, and their fate remains to be determined.
The FDIC is racing to find another bank over the weekend that is willing to merge with Silicon Valley Bank, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the details are confidential. While the FDIC hopes to put together such a merger by Monday to safeguard unsecured deposits, no deal is certain, the sources added.
An FDIC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Separately, SVB Financial, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank, is working with investment bank Centerview Partners and law firm Sullivan & Cromwell to find buyers for its other assets, which include investment bank SVB Securities, wealth manager Boston Private and equity research firm MoffettNathanson, the sources said. These assets could attract competitors and private equity firms, the sources added.
It's unclear if any buyer will step up to buy these assets without SVB Financial having filed for bankruptcy first. Credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings said on Friday it expected SVB Financial to enter bankruptcy because of its liabilities.
SVB did not respond to calls for comment.
Companies such as video game maker Roblox Corp RBLX.N and streaming device maker Roku Inc (ROKU.O) said they had hundreds of millions of dollars in deposits at the bank. Roku said its deposits with SVB were largely uninsured, sending its shares down 10% in extended trading.

Technology workers whose paychecks relied on the bank were also worried about getting their wages on Friday. An SVB branch in San Francisco showed a note taped to the door telling clients to call a toll-free telephone number.
SVB Financial CEO Greg Becker sent a video message to employees on Friday acknowledging the ""incredibly difficult"" 48 hours leading up to the collapse of the bank.
The problems at SVB underscore how a campaign by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to fight inflation by ending the era of cheap money is exposing vulnerabilities in the market. The worries walloped the banking sector.
U.S. banks have lost over $100 billion in stock market value over the past two days, with European banks losing around another $50 billion in value, according to a Reuters calculation.
U.S. lenders First Republic Bank (FRC.N) and Western Alliance (WAL.N) said on Friday their liquidity and deposits remained strong, aiming to calm investors as their shares fell. Others such as Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) issued unusual statements to reassure investors.
Some analysts forecast more pain for the sector as the episode spread concern about hidden risks in the banking sector and its vulnerability to the rising cost of money.
""There could be a bloodbath next week as...short sellers are out there and they are going to attack every single bank, especially the smaller ones,"" said Christopher Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met banking regulators on Friday and expressed ""full confidence"" in their abilities to respond to the situation, Treasury said.
The White House said on Friday it had faith and confidence in U.S. financial regulators, when asked about the failure of SVB.
The genesis of SVB's collapse lies in a rising interest rate environment. As higher interest rates caused the market for initial public offerings to shut down for many startups and made private fundraising more costly, some SVB clients started pulling money out.
To fund the redemptions, SVB sold a $21 billion bond portfolio consisting mostly of U.S. Treasuries on Wednesday, and said it would sell $2.25 billion in common equity and preferred convertible stock to fill its funding hole.
By Friday, the collapsing stock price had made its capital raise untenable and sources said the bank tried to look at other options, including a sale, until regulators stepped in and shut the bank down.
The last FDIC-insured institution to close was Almena State Bank in Kansas, on Oct. 23, 2020.

A California regulator shut Silicon Valley Bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver, according to the agency's statement. The shares were halted on Friday after tumbling as much as 66% in premarket trading.
With many stocks in the sector falling sharply on Friday, traders rushed in to defensive bets. The 30-day implied volatility on shares of the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE.P), a measure of how much traders expect its shares to swing in the near term - jumped to a 1-year high of 44%, data from options analytics firm Trade Alert showed.
Investors also splurged on defensive options contracts in a wide range of financials in the last two sessions, including heavyweights such as UBS Group , Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) and Charles Schwab , as well as smaller names such as Ally Financial (ALLY.N) and Ares Capital (ARCC.O).

Though SVB's troubles for now appear idiosyncratic to the firm, traders appeared on guard for the possibility that they could bode poorly for the broader sector as a campaign by the Federal Reserve to fight inflation by ending the era of cheap money is exposing vulnerabilities in the market.
""With fear of contagion in the regional banking sector, there was a slew of put buying in financials mostly using the options to protect against an about 10% decline in the underlying (shares),"" said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.
Puts offer the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and are typically used by traders looking to guard against a drop in stock prices.
Shares of SVB, whose operating segments include Silicon Valley Bank, slumped over 50% on Thursday after the company announced a $1.75 billion share sale late the previous day. SVB is battling cash burn due to declining deposits from startups struggling with a venture capital funding drought.
SVB's woes also knocked the banking sector on Friday as investors worried that more banks would incur heavy losses on their bond portfolios. Traders appear to expect the sector to remain volatile for some time. While most of the trading was concentrated in March through May expirations, some longer-dated trades extended out into the summer, Murphy said.
""Investors have re-rated banks on a sectoral basis, initiated a huge flight into the safety of short-term (Treasury) notes, and options pricing reflects those fears,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.
SVB's troubles piled further pressure on the sector already hurting from a more than 80% slide in Silvergate Capital's (SI.N) shares as the cryptocurrency-focused lender reels from losses following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.
While investors had largely shrugged off Silvergate’s troubles as strictly crypto-related, ""(SVB Financial Group) was a giant wake-up call about the effects of rising rates and an inverted yield curve,"" Sosnick said.

SVB's crisis comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve, locked in a battle against inflation, is raising interest rates and ending an era of cheap money. Investor fears about an aggressive rate hike at the Fed's next meeting later this month were eased on Friday by signs of cooling wage growth in the February jobs report.
The S&P 500 banks index (.SPXBK), which includes all banks in the benchmark index, dipped 0.5% leaving it with a weekly loss of about 11%, its biggest weekly decline since the global market meltdown in March 2020 following the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Money market funds invest in highly liquid near-term instruments such as cash and short term debt securities.
So far this year, investors have put $192 billion into cash, adding $18.1 billion in the week to Wednesday, BofA said. They invested $68.1 billion in cash a week earlier, more than at any time since the depths of the pandemic in 2020.
Market expectations for further rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which have sent U.S. yields higher, have also made money market funds more attractive. The yield on six-month U.S. Treasury bills reached 5.34% on Tuesday, its highest since 2006.
Elsewhere, there were weekly inflows to bond funds of $8.2 billion, and outflows from equities of $500 million and from gold of $4 million, according to the report.

Japan equity funds saw largest outflow ($3.0bn) since April 2018, according to BofA, a reversal given Japanese stocks have been in favour with foreign investors in recent weeks.
BofA also warned that the rapid increase in global interest rates, and market pricing for further hikes have generated what they call ""crashy vibes of March"".

Business,/business/finance/,Global equity funds draw first weekly inflow in four weeks - Refinitiv data,Reuters,2023-03-10 11:29:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GVELF2RHU5JUFHT237OXJ3DHR4.jpg,"March 10 (Reuters) - Global equity funds drew their first weekly inflow in four weeks in the seven days to March 8 after strong consumption boosted the service sector in some major economies, easing worries over a recession.
Still, expectations for further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation capped inflows.
Data from Refinitiv Lipper showed global equity funds obtained inflows worth a net $2.36 billion in the week to March 8, the most since Feb. 1.
Investors' appetite for riskier assets increased as data from the U.S., China and the euro zone showed strong demand for services in February.
But global equities came under selling pressure on Friday after a startup-lender Silicon Valley Bank flagged higher-than-expected ""cash burn"" from clients, falling deposits and rising costs of capital, triggering fears of banking-system stress.
European equity funds attracted a net $4.76 billion worth of inflows, but U.S. and Asian funds were out of favour with $1.23 billion and $760 million in net disposals.

Among sector funds, industrials and financials received inflows of $516 million and $339 million respectively, while the healthcare sector recorded $914 million in outflows.
Global bond funds attracted inflows for a 10th straight week as they received $5.72 billion net.
Global government bond funds received $3.77 billion in a fourth straight week of inflows, but high-yield and short- and medium-term bond funds had outflows of $168 million and $132 million, respectively.
At the same time, money market funds secured inflows worth $15.39 billion for a second straight week of net buying.
Among commodity funds, investors exited precious metal funds for a third straight week, removing $649 million, while withdrawing a marginal $89 million from energy funds.
Data for 23,826 emerging market funds showed equity funds secured a ninth weekly inflow worth $1.35 billion. Investors also purchased a net $367 million in bond funds after three weeks of net selling in a row.

Business,/business/finance/,"With dealmaking slowing, activist hedge funds target companies' top brass",Svea Herbst-Bayliss,2023-03-08 21:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/3GA3CPA4Q5PRLBKZODGURY3WOQ.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Activist hedge funds that often push companies to sell themselves or divest divisions are increasingly calling for top executives to be replaced, a change in tactics driven by a slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
These investors called for the removal of personnel at 60 U.S. companies last year, a 46% year-on-year increase, according to data from research firm Insightia. That was the most since 2017, the data show.
The trend reflects an overall decline in M&A activity as higher interest rates put the brakes on economic growth, fund managers and their advisers say. The total value of M&A fell 37% to $3.66 trillion last year after hitting an all-time high of $5.9 trillion in 2021, according to Dealogic data.
The push to oust executives also highlights the hedge funds' frustration with companies' stock performance after the S&P 500 Index tumbled 20% last year, said Ken Squire, who tracks activists at research firm 13D Monitor. Last year, activist investors' portfolios were down an average 17%, according to Hedge Fund Research, a poor showing after three years of double-digit gains.

""In down to flat markets, a failing CEO has few places to hide,"" said Squire.
Hedge funds that have successfully called for top executives to leave in recent months include Soroban Capital Partners, which helped oust railroad operator Union Pacific Corp's (UNP.N) CEO Lance Fritz, Ancora Holdings, which contributed to the exit of department store operator Kohl's Corp's (KSS.N) CEO Michelle Gass, and Sachem Head Capital Management, which targeted Pietro Satriano, the CEO of food distributor US Foods Holding Corp (USFD.N).
""When performance is poor, activists won't sit still,"" said Avinash Mehrotra, co-head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) mergers and acquisitions group in the Americas and global head of its activism defense practice.
According to Goldman Sachs data, one out of four S&P 500 companies have an activist investor in their stock. There are also challenges to companies that are being negotiated behind closed doors.
""For every publicly announced situation, our team is actively defending against two to three campaigns that will hopefully never see the light of day,"" Mehrotra said.
To be sure, the activist hedge funds are not abandoning their playbook of calling for companies to sell themselves or their assets, even as the chances of a deal have become more remote. Such requests in the United States were up 19% last year, according to Insightia.

Business,/business/finance/,"Hedge funds up leverage, but fear directional bets with blurred macro picture",Carolina Mandl,2023-03-09 00:34:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GVELF2RHU5JUFHT237OXJ3DHR4.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are increasingly using more leverage to make wagers on the stock market this year, but they remain less inclined to bet on the market direction due to heightened macroeconomic uncertainties.
Investors are focused on the economic picture as they try and assess the risk of upcoming recession as the U.S. Federal Reserve tries to bring inflation under control by hiking rates aggressively. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Powell said future interest rates hikes could go higher than market participants anticipated to fight inflation.
Hedge funds' gross exposure, or the sum of long and short positions - bets shares will rise and fall - as a percentage of their assets under management, last week reached peak levels for the last one year according to Goldman Sachs' prime services weekly report.
Gross exposure went up 2.5 percentage points for the period between Feb. 24 and Mar. 2, to 241% of assets, the report showed.
However, their long wagers minus short ones, known as net exposure - a measure of directional risk appetite - is close to a year low of 66%, Goldman Sachs showed. This illustrates that portfolio managers have little bias on overall market direction.

Hedge funds' more market neutral approach comes as market participants are trying to guess how high interest rates will get, for how long and when inflation will show consistent signs of decline - and its impact on the stock market.
Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest prime brokers, uses its clients' database to capture trends. Although the report does not reflect the entire $4 trillion industry, other market participants have expressed a more cautious approach.
Volatility has caught hedge funds off-guard. In the beginning of the year, an unexpected rally forced hedge funds betting against stocks to abandon those trades at the fastest pace since 2015. The S&P 500 went up roughly 9% at its peak in February 2, but trimmed gains to 4% now.
""Investors are not in full risk-on mode,"" said Eamon McCooey, head of prime services at Wells Fargo (WFC.N), adding his clients' dry powder are close to peak levels.
Long-short hedge fund Anson Funds, with $1.5 billion in assets under management, is roughly neutral, with shorts and longs matching off, portfolio manager Moez Kassam said. He said the fund is keeping cash and unused limits higher than in previous years due to economic uncertainties.
""Our macro view centers on inflation,"" he said. ""It will stay elevated longer than most expect.""
Higher interest rates are also forcing investors to make until recently unthinkable calculations, said Rob Christian, chief investment officer at hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, which manages a fund of hedge funds, as cash may provide a good return.
""Our hedge funds in general have been taking less risk,"" he said. ""Now two-year Treasury is a very attractive asset class relative to everything.""

Markets,/markets/asia/,Analysis: Chinese suppliers race to Vietnam as COVID let-up opens escape route from Sino-U.S. trade war,Francesco Guarascio,2023-03-16 04:12:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CD24GQHZLZK37IMTDT2VPJT5GM.jpg,"HANOI, March 16 (Reuters) - Vietnam has enjoyed a wave of investment from China since its neighbour abruptly canned its strict virus-containment strategy and unleashed pent-up interest from companies - and their suppliers - fleeing the impact of Sino-U.S. trade friction.
After China ended its zero-COVID-19 policy in December, Chinese firms spent the first 50 days of 2023 investing in 45 new projects in Vietnam, the most from a single country, Vietnamese government data showed.
With big-name players already in the Southeast Asian nation, attracted by its free-trade agreements and proximity to China, the companies making up the current wave of investors are mostly smaller suppliers to those larger firms, industry experts said.
Adding impetus to the move is the increasing cost of labour in China, expanding U.S. restrictions on high-tech-related trade with China, and tit-for-tat tariffs from a Sino-U.S. trade war that triggered a past wave of Chinese investment in Vietnam.

""Enquiries from Chinese firms about manufacturing investment in Vietnam grew exponentially in the last quarter of last year,"" said Michael Chan, senior director of leasing at industrial real estate specialist BW Industrial Development.
""Chinese investment has also increased remarkably,"" he said.
The earlier influx of major foreign corporations such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Canon Inc (7751.T) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) device assemblers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) (2317.TW) and Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (002475.SZ) contributed to rapid expansion of industrial clusters in sectors as varied as smartphones and printers.
But supplies for many still largely came from China. That country accounted for more than 20% of imported input for Vietnamese exports in 2021, nearly twice as much as in 2017, showed calculations from trade expert David Dollar of U.S. think tank Brookings Institution based on Asian Development Bank data.
Those smaller firms offering supplies and services to larger corporations with facilities already in Vietnam now make up the bulk of Chinese companies investing in Vietnam, particularly in the north just across the border, industry executives said.
The size of these suppliers is reflected in the average Chinese spend on new Vietnamese projects this year of roughly $5.6 million, compared with a long-term average of $6.5 million.
For instance, in Vietnam's solar panel industry, which is dominated by Chinese firms, there has been an inflow of providers of support services such as plastic moulding, die casting and energy storage, industry sources said.
Last year, Chinese panel maker suppliers, including power storage firm Growatt, were behind two of the main investments in Vietnam in ready-made factories, showed data from U.S real estate consultancy CBRE Group. Such factories are often favoured by smaller firms when entering new countries.
Growatt did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Chinese electronics, robotics and home appliance firms were also among top spenders on industrial leases last year, the data showed. Others included flooring firms, glass makers and suppliers of cartons and components for Apple gadgets assembled by the likes of Foxconn and Luxshare, said Do Hong Quan, head of Vietnam Investment Consulting, whose focus is Chinese investors.
In total, while economies worldwide struggle to normalise following the pandemic, and with a consequent fall of foreign investment in Vietnam, Chinese firms have tripled spending on new building sites in Vietnam so far this year to $250 million versus the same period a year earlier, official data showed. That is second only to investment from Singapore, and more than traditionally bigger investors such as South Korea and Japan.
Koen Soenens, sales director at DEEP C industrial zone in northern Vietnam, told Reuters the number of contracts his firm signed with Chinese companies in 2022 rose steeply toward year-end and in the last quarter was significantly higher than the number of contracts signed with firms from any other country.
""We expect this trend to continue this year based on enquiries we are receiving from China,"" Soenens said.
Among new partners, he cited automotive supplier Xiamen Sunrise Group Co Ltd (002593.SZ), solar panel component maker Hanghzou First Applied Material Co Ltd (603806.SS) and electric vehicle charging equipment maker Starchange. None of the companies responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
Making the move is not without risk. With thousands of years of bloody history between the neighbours, competing claims in the South China Sea unleashed entrenched anti-Chinese sentiment in 2014 with Vietnamese rioters targeting Chinese factories.
Investment applications from Chinese firms tend to be vetted with extra care, resulting in delays or rejections which encourage investment through shell companies domiciled in Hong Kong or Singapore instead, industry experts and diplomats said.
Chinese firms also experience longer times to obtain staff visas and work permits, said Filippo Bortoletti, who heads the Vietnamese unit of investment consultancy Dezan Shira.
Neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor the Ministry of Planning and Investment responded to requests for comment.
However, such risks are not enough to deter small firms.
""Chinese companies move here mostly to serve their clients who moved earlier,"" said BW Industrial Development's Chan.

A crisis of confidence in Credit Suisse this week added to broader banking sector fears sparked by last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank in the United States.
In Japan, expectations of a strong post-COVID recovery are quickly fading amid global monetary tightening and the worries about banks worldwide.
""If the global economic slowdown intensifies, the G7 must share awareness of banking issues,"" said senior Komeito party member of parliament Isamu Ueda, who heads a financial panel in the party, part of the ruling coalition.
""We need to carefully watch developments from now on,"" Ueda told Reuters, while echoing cautiously optimistic views of Japanese policymakers.

More than a decade ago, the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers quickly snowballed into the 2008/09 global financial crisis.
Leaders of the G7, which is under the chairmanship of Japan this year, will gather in the western Japanese city of Hiroshima for a summit in May. The G7 groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
Ueda attended Bank of Japan's policy reviews as deputy finance minister about two decades ago and debated monetary policy with the incoming BOJ governor, Kazuo Ueda, when the latter served as a central bank board member.
""His explanation on monetary policy is easy to understand and I had an impression that his communication ability is high,"" said Isamu Ueda, who is not related to the new central bank governor.
""His basic stance is to continue large-scale easing for the time being, although he may probably respond flexibly to markets as needed,"" the lawmaker said.

Credit Suisse's shares were still up more than 20% after the Swiss National Bank and financial regulator, FINMA, had rowed in with support, but the broader European banking sector (.MIEU0BK00PEU) had given back much its 2.5% morning rally with the ECB now looming.
The SNB confirmed on Thursday that it will provide ""liquidity"" to the lender. Credit Suisse, which said it is taking ""decisive action"", will borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs from one of the world's leading central banks.
Europe's banking stocks had suffered their steepest one-day drop in more than a year on Wednesday in the wake of the CS woes and though shares were backsliding again, bond traders at least still seemed confident enough ahead of the ECB to be selling safe-haven government bonds again.

ECB President Christine Lagarde has been widely signalling a 50 basis point hike, but the last week of turmoil, which has also seen two U.S. banks collapse, means markets now see it as roughly a 50/50 call between 50 bps and 25 bps.
""I worry that the ECB is not going to pay enough attention to this risk (banking sector problems) and that could be a mistake,"" said Stefan Gerlach, Chief Economist at EFG Bank in Zurich and a former deputy governor at Ireland's central bank.
The last week demonstrates what happens when major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve and the ECB raise interest rates by hundreds of basis points in a short period of time, he added.
""Whenever you do something that large, you know there is a risk waiting somewhere in the financial system,"" Gerlach said. ""It is like stretching a rubber band, if you keep stretching it, is it going to break?""
Germany's two-year bond yield , which is highly sensitive to ECB rate expectations, was last up 18 basis points (bps) at 2.56% having plunged 54 bps on Wednesday in what had been a market-wide scramble for safety.
Overnight, Asian shares had fallen around 1% but it was largely a catch-up move and had none of the frenzy witnessed in Europe the previous day.
Wall Street futures were also pointing to a steady start there later , while demand had dropped for both the dollar and gold, the traditional go-to plays for investors during market turbulence.
Many investors though said it was far too early to give the all clear.
JPMorgan analysts said the loan from the SNB would not be enough to soothe investor concerns and the ""status quo was no longer an option"", leaving a takeover for Credit Suisse as the most likely outcome.
Moritz Kraemer, Chief Economist at LBBW Bank in Germany, said that while Credit Suisse wasn't an insolvency issue the way Silicon Valley Bank had been in the United States late last week but others remained jittery.
""The word contagion is knocking about,"" said Damian Rooney, a dealer at Perth stockbroker Argonaut. ""We're getting fear across the whole board here,"" he said. ""The trouble is with the unwinding - you don't know what you don't know.""
Overnight, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) had dropped 1% to its lowest level this year. Japan's bank shares, which are also seen as vulnerable to interest rate rises, (.IBNKS.T) ended down 3.25% although had been down more at one point.
U.S. data showed another dip in unemployment claims. Two-year U.S. Treasuries are eying their best week since 1987 and yields, which fall when prices rise, are below 4% again and down more than 60 basis points since Friday.
The euro last stood 0.2% higher at $1.059 and the Swiss franc was up 0.8% at 0.9258 to the dollar. The preference for safety was still supporting the yen which was up 0.4% at 132.35 per dollar in London trading.
Oil prices also clawed back some ground after sliding to 15-month lows in the previous session. Brent crude futures were up 60 cents or 0.8% to $74.29 per barrel while West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) rose to $68.08 a barrel.

A Swiss lifeline to the ailing Credit Suisse has eased some pressure on Europe's anxious banks but leaves the European Central Bank in a dilemma over whether or not it will aggravate the situation if it goes ahead with a planned interest rate hike on Thursday.
After suffering a withering collapse of its stock and bond prices on Wednesday that jarred global banks once again, Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) announced it would seek official help and borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence.
The Swiss lender said it would exercise an option to borrow from its central bank up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion). That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday the country's second largest bank met ""the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"".
But the reaction was tepid in the CS share price itself and in wider banking, stock and bond markets - roiled over the past week by the reverberations from two bank failures in the United States.
View 2 more stories 
Credit Suisse's stock, which is down about 70% over the past year and some 25% year to date, bounced from Wednesday's record low. But - at the time of writing at least - remained down 7% from Tuesday's close. European bank stocks (.SX7E) jumped 2%, but regained only about a third of what they lost Wednesday.
Policymakers and regulators across Europe and Asia rushed to reassure the public and markets that banks in their jurisdictions were safe and well-capitalised. But if public and market confidence, as much as raw balance sheet math, is now the big issue, then it may take more than soothing words.
Much now hinges on how the macro policymakers react and how ECB will respond later on Thursday.
Like other central banks, the ECB has been raising interest rates rapidly to curb inflation and has since July tightened credit at its fastest pace on record.
It had publicly flagged another 50 basis point increase on Thursday, but the banking turmoil surrounding the failure of Silicon Valley Bank at the weekend and Credit Suisse's near-death experience question the wisdom of that if there's a risk of a credit crunch from the banking stress anyway.
Interest rates markets have been gyrating wildly all week as a result of the conundrum, trying to second guess whether the Federal Reserve and ECB lean more toward their financial stability rather than strict inflation mandates.
As it stands, money markets now price an 80% chance the ECB will move tentatively and only hike by a quarter point to 2.75%. But already markets now assume the ECB's peak rate for the cycle will top out at 3% - a full point below where it was only early last week.
The euro bounced slightly from the 2023 lows it hit yesterday, during which it recorded its biggest one-day drop in almost 6 months.
But there was little improvement in U.S. market prices first thing, with S&P500 (.SPX) futures seeing no recovery from another day of heavy losses on Wednesday. The VIX (.VIX) volatility gauge, or 'fear index', edged higher again to 26 - about 7 points up from where it was this time last week.
The real eye-watering swings were reserved for U.S. rates and bond yields as markets desperately try to second guess the Fed's reaction function to all the turmoil ahead of its policymaking meeting next week.
Although futures now see a 66% chance the Fed will raise rates by another quarter point into a 4.75-5.0% range, many economists are now openly doubting whether it will move at all again in this current cycle and there are almost 80bps of rate cuts now priced by year-end.
Two-year Treasury yields, which have been swinging violently back and forth over the past week, were clinging to 4% first thing on Thursday - more than a full percentage point down on last week.
But the extreme volatility in what is seen as a 'safe' or 'risk-free' asset is troubling in its own right.
Implied volatility gauges for the U.S. Treasury market (.MOVE) surged again on Wednesday to their highest since the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bust in 2008.
The index has doubled in just 6 weeks and its rise since Monday is the second biggest one-week move in the 20-year history of the index.
Elsewhere, geopolitical tensions will do nothing to calm the horses.
China's foreign ministry said on Thursday the United States had yet to provide evidence that TikTok threatened national security and that the U.S. should stop suppressing such companies.
TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, said on Wednesday President Joe Biden's administration had demanded TikTok's Chinese owners divest their stakes in the popular video app or face a possible U.S. ban.
Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:
* US March Philadelphia Fed business survey, NY Fed services sector survey; US Feb export/import prices, housing starts/permits; weekly jobless claims
* European Central Bank policy decision

For the upcoming inspection, the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) has picked branches of EY, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers and some other audit firms in both Hong Kong and mainland China, one of the sources said.
A group of Chinese officials will be dispatched by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to assist the inspection in Hong Kong, the second source said.
U.S. regulators last year spent weeks reviewing auditors' work in Hong Kong, then in December said they had obtained full inspection access, removing the immediate risk that around 200 Chinese companies could be booted off U.S. stock exchanges.

That visit came after U.S. and China reached a landmark deal last August to settle a long-running dispute over auditing compliance of U.S.-listed Chinese firms. Authorities in China have long been reluctant to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms, citing national security concerns.
For the upcoming reviews, officials from both sides will follow a protocol similar to last year's onsite inspection in Hong Kong, said the sources, who were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
A spokesperson for the PCAOB, which oversees registered public accounting firms around the world, declined to comment for this story, noting the board does not comment on ongoing inspections.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of Finance, EY, Deloitte, and PwC did not immediately respond to Reuters' queries.
The PCAOB said in December it had full access to inspect and investigate New York-listed Chinese companies for the first time ever, after conducting an onsite inspection in Hong Kong that looked into the audits of the selected companies.
The regulator then said the teams had been making plans to resume regular inspections and investigations in China in early 2023 and beyond.
It also warned that any obstruction of inspection access could affect Chinese firms' listings in the U.S.
Under the PCAOB's inspection guidelines, in general, each auditing firm is subject to inspection either annually, if the firm provides audit opinions for more than 100 issuers, or otherwise once every three years, said Jessica Zhou, partner at law firm White & Case, based in Hong Kong.
""In light of the PCAOB's recent, successful completion of its inspections of selected firms in Hong Kong, there is reason to be optimistic that the additional inspections will similarly be carried out in accordance with the agreement,"" she said, referring to the deal reached last year.
A mainland branch under KPMG and a Hong Kong branch under PwC were picked by the PCAOB in last year's inspections, the PCAOB said earlier.
PCAOB staff identified ""numerous potential deficiencies"" in their inspection work last year, and inspection reports will be finalised and made public this year, the regulator said earlier.

German corporate treasurers were urged by an industry association not to ""underestimate the current situation"", after Switzerland's second-biggest bank Credit Suisse sought to shore up its liquidity and restore investor confidence by borrowing up to $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank.
The blog post from the Association of German Treasurers, entitled ""SVB collapse not without consequences for treasurers"", asked whether this event was a ""Lehman 2.0"" moment.
Policymakers have stressed that the situation following the demise of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is different to the global financial crisis sparked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers more than a decade ago as banks are now better capitalised and funds, which dried up almost overnight in 2008, more easily available.

Allianz, one of Europe's biggest financial firms, said that authorities were ""well equipped"" to deal with any liquidity crisis, unlike during"" the global financial crisis.
But Carsten Linker, head of the German treasurers association's risk management department, said: ""The speed and scope of such crisis developments in the capital market are always remarkable.""
""Increased attention to potential consequential or amplifying effects is also a must,"" Linker was quoted as saying, referring to the interconnectedness of markets that could quickly trigger further problems in Europe.
Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.DE), the German container shipping group, said it was ""observing the situation very closely"", with a similar comment from German chemicals maker BASF (BASFn.DE).
""Globalization is wonderful, but it also opens avenues of contagion. And we simply don't know yet the degree to which the fallout can hit European banks,"" said Utz Greiner, a partner at Vienna-based treasurer consultants Schwabe, Ley & Greiner.
""I would expect corporates to take precautionary measures,"" he said, suggesting they move cash deposits into money markets.
He also advised diversifying banks and organising new undrawn credit lines, although added both can take months.
Greiner estimated that only 20-30% of German small-cap companies were fully equipped with best corporate treasury practices for moments of market stress.
The post from the German treasurers association said that the country's capital and banking markets faced only ""moderate"" impacts from turbulence in the wake of SVB's collapse.
""Nevertheless, treasurers should not underestimate the current situation, even if they themselves are not directly or indirectly affected,"" it wrote.

A week ago start-up lender Silicon Valley Bank in California failed, and now a systemic bank in one of Europe's financial capitals is in enough trouble to seek authorities' help.
Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) - which tumbled 24% in the previous session - on Thursday said it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to shore up liquidity and investor confidence after a slump in its shares intensified fears about a global banking crisis.
Saudi Arabia's benchmark index (.TASI) retreated 0.7%, weighed down by a 1.4% fall in Retal Urban Development Co (4322.SE) and a 2.9% slide in the country's biggest lender Saudi National Bank SNB (1180.SE).

The chair of SNB, which last year acquired an almost 10% stake in Credit Suisse, said on Wednesday the bank was not considering any specific international opportunities.
The lender has lost more than $26 billion in market value since Oct. 27 after committing to invest in the embattled Credit Suisse.
Egypt's blue-chip index (.EGX30) inched 0.1% lower, with Commercial International Bank (COMI.CA) losing 1%. The Egyptian index posted a weekly loss of more than 10%.
In Egypt, the increasingly large initial public offering (IPO) program could become a growth factor for the stock market and could help reverse the current downtrend, said Daniel Takieddine, CEO MENA at BDSwiss.

Markets,/markets/rates-bonds/,Exclusive: UK debt agency treads careful path to sell near-record volume of bonds,David Milliken,2023-03-16 06:59:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Britain is trying to limit the burden on bond dealers as it prepares to sell the highest volume of government debt since the COVID-19 pandemic against a backdrop of turbulent markets, the head of the UK Debt Management Office (DMO) said on Wednesday.
After finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced his budget plans earlier on Wednesday, the DMO said it would need to sell 241.1 billion pounds ($291 billion) of government bonds in the 2023/24 financial year - the highest on record apart from 485.8 billion pounds sold in 2020/21.
In some ways, the challenge now is even tougher. The Bank of England is no longer a buyer in the market, and instead is reducing its own gilt holdings by 80 billion pounds a year.
And recent days have seen some of the biggest daily price swings in decades in fixed income markets, as investors reset their interest rate expectations following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and concerns about Credit Suisse.
View 2 more stories 
""Global financial markets are pretty stressed and volatile. Some of the movements that have occurred over the last week in fixed income markets have been huge,"" DMO chief executive Robert Stheeman told Reuters.
Britain experienced its own bond market turmoil in late September and October, when an adverse reaction to then Prime Minister Liz Truss's plans for unfunded tax cuts forced the Bank of England to intervene.
""The big difference now is that these movements are not UK-driven,"" Stheeman said.
Britain has seen strong investor demand at most of its bond auctions, although a handful of auctions have had to accept slightly low bids to sell the full volume of debt on offer.
The DMO now wants to ensure that its primary dealers - a group of 17 major financial institutions which have the right to take part in British government debt auctions - are not overburdened by the amount of debt they need to bid for and sell on to customers.
""Behind the scenes, we're very focused on the duration risk and spreading that out, and make sure that supply doesn't unnecessarily weigh on the balance sheet capacity and the intermediation capacity of our primary dealers,"" Stheeman said.
""We do what we can, while obviously needing to raise a very large amount of money.""
In practice, that can mean a skew towards short-dated bonds with a maturity of under seven years, although British government debt continues to have the longest maturity of any major economy.
""We can issue larger cash amounts in, for instance, a short-dated auction than in a long- or index-linked auction,"" Stheeman said.
Over the coming year, the DMO aims to sell 86.7 billion pounds of short-dated bonds, 65.3 billion pounds of medium-dated, 50.1 billion pounds of long-dated gilts and 26.2 billion pounds of inflation-linked debt.
The medium- and long-dated debt includes 10 billion pounds of 'green' bonds - a volume that is capped by the requirement for the government to designate investment projects which meet certain environmental criteria.
The DMO has also had to develop a working relationship with the Bank of England, which now has its own separate bond auction programme. The two organisations have agreed not to hold auctions on the same day as each other, but there can now be as many as four separate British government bond sales in a week.
""This is a process that's been going on now for a couple of months, and which so far has worked quite well,"" Stheeman said. ""It does mean of course that the calendar looks very crowded from the perspective of the street.""

Markets,/markets/us/,Americans are wary of bailouts as banking concerns mount -Reuters/Ipsos poll,Jason Lange,2023-03-15 22:28:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QWIUFUGTBVNZFACSYB4TLII46I.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - A bipartisan majority of Americans oppose U.S. taxpayers footing the bill when bad management causes a bank to fail, though Republican opposition to bank bailouts has softened over the last decade, a Reuters/Ipsos poll completed on Wednesday found.
The poll's results point to a potential political problem for Democratic President Joe Biden's administration should the signs of shakiness in the U.S. banking sector worsen and prompt more aggressive government action.
The two-day Reuters/Ipsos poll found 84% of respondents - including strong majorities of Republicans and Democrats - think taxpayers should not have to pay to resolve problems caused by irresponsible bank management.
Stock markets have swooned around the world since Silicon Valley Bank collapsed on Friday as worried customers pulled their deposits. Two days later, New York's Signature Bank closed. On Wednesday, U.S. stocks fell sharply as turbulence at Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) revived fears of a new banking crisis.

Banks have been stressed in recent months by rising interest rates, which reduce demand for borrowing money. In a series of moves telegraphed in advance to investors, the U.S. Federal Reserve, America's central bank, has pushed interest rates higher over the last year in a bid to tame inflation.
Only 49% of Americans - 40% of Republicans and 55% of Democrats - said they favored government bailouts of financial institutions.
Still, support for bailouts was even more tepid a decade earlier, when the United States was emerging from a financial crisis which the government fought by spending hundreds of billions of dollars on bank bailouts. In a 2012 Reuters/Ipsos poll, only 20% of Republicans and 53% of Democrats said they supported bailouts.
About half of respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they had heard at least a fair amount about Silicon Valley Bank's implosion.
Sixty-eight percent said they had at least a fair amount of confidence in the stability of their own bank, and the same percentage had at least that level of confidence in banks more generally.
Some 77% of respondents said that shareholders and executives who profited from a bank in the days before it failed should have to return those funds to depositors.
U.S. regulators promised to make whole all depositors at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, even those with accounts above the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's standard $250,000 limit, without taxpayers having to cover any costs. Businesses make up many of the bank clients whose money had not been previously guaranteed by the government.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll showed broad bipartisan support for Washington backing bank deposits. Seventy-eight percent of respondents said the government should guarantee the deposits of individuals and 70% said Washington should backstop company deposits.
But a strong bipartisan majority also said depositors in banks should understand the risk of using a bank to make deposits outside of FDIC limits.
Some experts say the more expansive deposit guarantees regulators are applying for the troubled banks already amount to a bailout because they remove people's incentive to guard against financial risk.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted online, surveyed 1,004 people nationwide and had a credibility interval of about 4 percentage points in either direction.

Markets,/markets/us/,"FDIC returned $40 bln in U.S. Treasury funds, reversing withdrawal after SVB takeover",David Lawder,2023-03-15 21:47:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WEXO2VRANJLXPM4YYJXVAURUVE.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp deposited $40 billion back into the U.S. Treasury General Account on Tuesday, reversing a $40 billion withdrawal on Friday as the regulator took control of the failed Silicon Valley Bank, Treasury financial data released on Wednesday showed.
A Treasury spokesperson referred questions about the fund transfers to the FDIC, which declined comment.
On Tuesday, before the restoration of the funds was disclosed in the latest Daily Treasury Statement, the Treasury said that the $40 billion withdrawal would not affect estimates for when it would no longer be able to pay all U.S. government bills without a debt ceiling increase.
After the initial $40 billion withdrawal on Friday as SVB Financial was closed and put under FDIC receivership, the Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve on Sunday announced guarantees for both insured and uninsured deposits at the institution to shore up confidence in the banking system.
The same protections were offered to New York's Signature Bank (SBNY.O), which failed on Sunday, and the Federal Reserve opened a new facility to give the banks access to emergency funds.

The restoration of the funds to Treasury's cash balance held at the Fed came a day after SVB and Signature reopened on Monday with access to the Fed facilities, which allow them to borrow from the Fed's discount window by pledge bonds at par value as collateral, rather than at their diminished market value.

Markets,/markets/rates-bonds/,Analysis: Some highly rated US companies take unusual funding route as rates rise,Shankar Ramakrishnan,2023-02-27 16:45:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5L6OUE6U6ZMGTLAG45HPVGST3E.jpg,"Feb 27 (Reuters) - Some highly rated U.S. companies have issued bonds that convert to shares to raise several billion dollars so far this year, in what bankers said signals a shift in a market that has long been dominated by companies with few other options to raise money.
Investment-grade-rated companies have traditionally avoided such convertible securities because they risk giving away shares at a discount to the market price, lowering the value of their stock. Credit-worthy companies have found in the past that they can raise funds more cheaply in investment-grade bond markets.
But in the past week alone, two highly rated utility companies -- PPL Corp (PPL.N) and Southern Co (SO.N) -- raised a total of $2.4 billion through convertible bonds, making them the first investment-grade utilities in 20 years to do so. They were able to issue the securities at much lower interest rates than what they would have had to pay on a bond.
So far this year, investment-grade companies have helped boost convertible bond issuance volumes to $8.5 billion, putting the market on pace to reach $65 billion to $70 billion this year, or more than double the amount raised in 2022 and returning to the levels of previous years, one banker said.

Craig McCracken, co-head of equity capital markets at Wells Fargo, said more investment-grade companies were showing interest, promising to make 2023 ""a breakout year relative to 2022"" for convertible bond issuance.
The entry of some investment-grade companies in the convertible bond market shows how the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rapid interest rate hikes to stamp out inflation have created anomalies in the marketplace. In recent weeks, economic resilience in the face of the Fed’s campaign has added to uncertainty about the path of the stock market and interest rates in the coming months.
In interviews, two bankers and an investor said that uncertainty has made convertible bonds an attractive option to raise money for some investment-grade companies. That is supported by an accounting rule change last year that made it less expensive for companies to issue convertible bonds and by steady demand from funds dedicated to investing in these securities, they said.
""Convertibles are the cheapest available financing for both high-yield and high-grade issuers right now,"" said Josh Schaeffer, managing director at accounting firm Equity Methods.
Convertible bonds are hybrid securities. Like a regular bond, they pay a coupon and their yields change with interest rates. But their value also depends on the company's stock price, as they can convert to shares. The hybrid nature can limit the risk but also add to it.
Earlier this week, for example, investors bought PPL’s convertible bond at 100 cents on the dollar, or at par. The bond was trading at 101 cents on Friday.
Investors were betting on an appreciation in the shares of the company, according to Howard Needle, portfolio manager at Wellesley Asset Management, which bought the bond.
PPL’s stock is up 19% from a low of $23.28 in October last year.
Because defensive stocks such as utilities like PPL could benefit if interest rates keep rising, potential returns for investors in convertible bonds could be boosted. That environment would make convertible bonds attractive to such companies because it would instill confidence that their offerings would successfully raise money.
On the flip side, investment-grade companies in other sectors whose stock prices suffer when rates rise would likely shy away from the convertible bond market because their product would be less attractive to investors.
For PPL, these factors have meant it was able to raise $900 million through a five-year convertible bond that paid a 2.875% coupon. Southern's 2.75-year bonds pay 3.875%. Both are much lower than the average investment-grade corporate bond yield of 5.48% (.MERC0A0).
Wells Fargo's McCracken said that in addition to the lure of cost savings, convertibles have become more palatable to higher-rated companies because of an accounting change in 2022.
A U.S. accounting rule had required that companies issuing convertibles add in a hypothetical interest expense on the bond, adding to the cost of issuance. That rule was eliminated last year.

Markets,/markets/commodities/,"China, air travel rebound set to supercharge oil demand -IEA",Noah Browning,2023-03-15 11:15:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Global oil demand is edging up slowly but is set for a huge boost from resumed air travel and China's economic reopening after COVID-19 curbs, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday.
""Global oil demand growth started 2023 with a whimper but is projected to end the year with a bang,"" the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil report.
""Rebounding jet fuel use and a resurgent China will see an overall 1Q-4Q ramp-up of 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd), the largest relative in-year increase since 2010.""
The agency kept its forecasts for Chinese and global demand relatively steady from the previous month, at 16 million bpd and 102 million bpd, respectively.
Oil supply is still outstripping relatively slow demand, the IEA added, but the market is set to balance by around the middle of the year with China and developing countries driving demand.
""Real-time indicators for Chinese mobility mostly stabilised after January’s remarkable bounce, led by air traffic with domestic flights now well above pre-pandemic levels,"" the IEA said.

High inflation and investor concerns over high interest rates cloud the economic horizon and could pose a risk to fuel demand, the IEA warned, adding that concerns over the health of the U.S. banking sector also carried potential downside risks.
Meanwhile commercial oil stocks in the developed countries of the OECD reached an 18-month high as demand ebbed and Europe ramped up storage ahead of bans on some Russian crude and refined products imports.
Russian oil production stayed near pre-war levels in February despite sanctions on its seaborne exports.
Still, crude exports fell 500,000 bpd while a new European Union ban on its seaborne products and a U.S.-led international price cap - both starting on Feb. 5 - cut Russian products exports by 650,000 bpd.

Markets,/markets/commodities/,Column: East Asia set to win scramble for wind power dominance by 2030,Gavin Maguire,2023-03-15 09:20:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FUPUQVA3ZVPEXDKAIZ5NCCJNVQ.jpg,"LITTLETON, Colorado, March 14 (Reuters) - East Asia is set to remain the top wind power production region thanks to a project development pipeline that will expand current wind power capacity by 65% by the end of 2030, according to data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM).
Wind is the largest and fastest-growing source of renewable power globally, and is expanding by a record pace in every major economy as part of global efforts to transition energy systems away from fossil fuels and reduce harmful emissions.
Wind power generated roughly 7.8% of the world's electricity in 2022, but must expand by enough to produce 21% of global electricity by 2030 if net-zero emissions goals are to be achieved, according to think tank Ember.
Such aggressive expansion targets mean that the recent breakneck development pace must be maintained or surpassed annually for the rest of the decade, and be distributed throughout the world's largest power consuming regions.
View 2 more stories 
China will remain the largest wind producer and top wind capacity developer, but South Korea, Japan and Taiwan will all post faster growth rates than China through 2030, according to GEM.
China's current wind generation capacity of 278,876 megawatts (MW) will balloon by 41% to nearly 400,000 MW once projects that are currently under construction or planned by 2030 come online, GEM data shows.
While no other country will match the sheer scale of China's wind power additions, many will dwarf its growth rate as they play catch up with the world's green power leader.
South Korea, which currently ranks 38th on the global list of wind power by capacity, will vault to 6th place by the end of 2030 once all 40,869 MW of planned and under-construction projects come on stream - a 3,275% swell from current capacity.
Taiwan is set to grow its current wind capacity by 823% to 16,460 MW, while Japan's is set to grow by 440% or by roughly 15,000 MW to nearly 19,000 MW in total by 2030.
Combined, these East Asian countries are set to account for 36.2% of world wind capacity by 2030, GEM data shows, with the region remaining the largest hub for wind power.
Europe will be the second largest wind power developer over the remainder of this decade, boosting capacity by 68% from current levels.
Germany, Spain, France and Sweden plan to boost their collective capacity by nearly 40,000 MW by 2030, and will all rank among the top 10 global wind producers.
Other large capacity increases are planned in Poland, Finland and the United Kingdom, ensuring that the region's largest economies will all benefit from double-digit growth in green energy supply capacity within the coming decade.
Steep wind power growth will also be seen across the Americas, with the United States set to cement its position as the second largest wind producer via a 53% swell in current capacity to 212,133 MW by 2030.
Brazil looks set to more than treble its current wind capacity and jump to third in global rankings from 7th place currently, while Canada and Mexico also look primed for notable growth.
India's wind power capacity will climb by 25% by 2030, but the country will slip in world rankings from 4th to 7th as other nations bring greater wattage online.
South Africa, currently Africa's top ranked wind producer (25th), will drop to 28th by 2030, and be replaced by Egypt as the continent's top wind generator, followed by Morocco and Algeria.
Saudi Arabia looks set to be the largest wind power producer in the Middle East once it raises current capacity by 125% to 900MW.
Australia and New Zealand are also set for rapid wind power expansion over the coming years, with current capacity primed to jump by 422% or roughly 52,000MW to 64,109MW if all planned projects tracked by GEM come to fruition.
Such a steep increase in renewable power capacity has the potential to drastically reshape Australia's power system, and potentially turn the country into a net power exporter if proposed interconnection lines feeding Southeast Asia are built.
Vietnam is also primed for major wind power growth, with over 11,000 MW of capacity planned by 2030 to cement the country's status as a top-20 global wind producer.
In all, given the rapid pace of wind expansion in every region, the global goal of having wind power generate over 20% of global electricity by 2030 is potentially achievable, especially if outdated fossil fuel generation capacity is shuttered over the same period.

In pellet production, coal is usually mixed with iron ore before being heated in plant furnaces. In Vale's pilot project, conducted in February in Minas Gerais state, the so-called biocarbon obtained from biomass replaced traditional coal, an especially dirty fossil fuel.
Industrial heavyweights like Vale face growing pressure to lower harmful emissions that contribute to global warming, from governments, activists as well as investors.
During Vale's pilot, 15,000 tonnes of coal-free pellets were made with 100% biocarbon from certified supplies, according to the company. Biocarbon is a renewable energy source obtained through biomass carbonization, which results in much lower emissions.

Pellets are typically made by crushing and grinding low-grade iron ore and used as a key ingredient to make steel.
Pellet production is the most carbon-intensive process contributing to Vale's direct emissions, with anthracite coal accounting for about half of its greenhouse gas emissions from making pellets, said Rodrigo Araujo, the miner's head of decarbonization projects.
Overall, making pellets accounts for 30% of the firm's direct emissions.
Vale will carry out further tests this year, aiming to permanently replace all coal used in its pellet plants by 2030.
""It was very important to confirm what we saw in the laboratory, which had no impact on the quality of the pellet, the first barrier we wanted to overcome, and also the entire test in relation to logistics, process, storage, material management and related risks,"" said Araujo.
The project is part of Vale's strategy to fulfill its commitment to net zero carbon emissions in direct and indirect emissions by 2050.

Markets,/markets/europe/,"Tech pressure, Yellen everywhere: How Washington scrambled as SVB collapsed",Andrea Shalal,2023-03-15 18:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/J24G7MR2KJN75NZZY4IR7WFL2Y.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. government launched emergency measures on Sunday to shore up confidence in the banking system after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O), the largest bank collapse since the 2008 financial crisis.
European bank stocks fell on Wednesday, with Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) diving as much as 30% on renewed investor concerns about stresses within the sector.
The U.S. measures came after heavy pressure from California's tech industry to act and fueled several long and dramatic days in Washington and beyond.
As U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen prepares for a Friday hearing before the Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee, investors are raising concerns about a liquidity crisis at Silicon Valley Bank, sending the stock plummeting.
Questions had been swirling for weeks around the tech-focused bank, which had assets of $209 billion, and a quickening pace of withdrawals triggered alarm bells.
View 2 more stories 
Amid concern the bank would not last the weekend, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Federal Reserve Board decide to move it into receivership.
Yellen's staff plan a meeting with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Fed and the FDIC for Friday.
Officials arrive to close the bank at its Santa Clara, California headquarters before West Coast branches open, noon Eastern time.
U.S. President Joe Biden is briefed on the SVB situation by his new chief of staff Jeff Zients and former Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard, who took over as director of Biden's National Economic Council on Feb. 21, as Yellen testifies for three hours in a contentious congressional hearing. Only one lawmaker asks about SVB.
Yellen assures Congress she is monitoring events surrounding ""a few banks"" and says any bank's financial losses are concerning.
She holds a 1 p.m. Eastern virtual meeting with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, Michael Hsu, acting Comptroller of the Currency, and Mary Daly, president and CEO of the San Francisco Federal Reserve.
At 2:30 p.m., Treasury issues a statement about confidence in regulators and the overall resilience of the U.S. banking system.
Some tech investors start offering cash to prop up their companies, others take to Twitter to push the Biden administration to act.
Late Friday, Treasury officials brief lawmakers; one Republican staffer seeks assurances the plans will not lead to more regulation.
The FDIC makes a record withdrawal of $40 billion from the Treasury General Account as it seizes control of Silicon Valley Bank, an amount many times larger than any previous draws.
Regulators learn a second bank, New York-based Signature, which had almost a quarter of its deposits from the cryptocurrency sector, is facing similar liquidity problems.
U.S. Treasury staff hold virtual morning meetings, deciding to: 1) Look for a buyer; 2) provide a systemic risk exemption to protect depositors; 3) revamp the terms of a Fed facility to permit more borrowing.
Yellen meets again with Powell, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, and Gruenberg from the FDIC, and they agree to do all three. The rush is on to assure SVB's depositors that they can make payroll on Monday and get ahead of Asian markets opening on Sunday around 6 p.m. ET.
Depositors will be ""made whole,"" but the bank's management will be removed and investors will lose their funds.
U.S. officials jump into ""hundreds of Zoom calls"" and answer emails from anxious lawmakers worried about small businesses in their districts, tech industry executives, and business owners who fear they will have to lay off workers, a White House official says.
Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, fearful of what he calls a potential ""extinction level event"" in the tech sector, launches a petition signed by more than 3,500 CEOs and founders, appealing directly to Yellen.
Saturday evening, more than 600 Washington VIPs, including administration officials, lawmakers, reporters and editors gather for the annual white-tie Gridiron Dinner. Brainard and a key aide to Yellen both cancel at the last minute.
Yellen pre-tapes a nearly 13-minute-long interview with CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" program at 8:30 a.m. ET on Sunday. Federal officials are working on a ""timely"" solution, she says, and rules out a bailout.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp says its withdrawal of a record $40 billion in U.S. Treasury Funds on Friday as it seized control of Silicon Valley Bank will not affect when the Treasury runs out of operating room under the debt ceiling.
The Federal Reserve is considering tougher rules and oversight for midsize banks, according to a source familiar with the matter. A review of the $209-billion bank's failure being conducted by Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr could lead to strengthened rules on banks in the $100 billion to $250 billion range.

Markets,/markets/currencies/,Sterling ticks lower as banking turmoil clouds rate outlook,Amanda Cooper,2023-03-16 12:21:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/RWSHRAV7WBIB3P2FW7ZJD45LCA.jpg,"LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The pound eased on Thursday, losing out to the euro ahead of the European Central Bank's policy decision later in the day, but held steady against the dollar, as a degree of calm returned to global markets.
Sterling was last down just 0.1% against the dollar at $1.2048, easing for a third day in a row, while against the euro it sank 0.4% to 88.06 pence.
A little more stability crept into markets after Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) said it would use a $54-billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity and restore investor confidence that has taken a bashing this week as problems at Switzerland's second-biggest bank have mounted.
The pound drew little comfort from Jeremy Hunt's spring budget the day before, in which the UK finance minister said the economy would avoid recession this year.
""The chancellor’s budget statement yesterday was overshadowed by the focus on European banks but the pound's undertone is typically not determined by the government’s fiscal policy anyway,"" Scotiabank chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne said.
View 2 more stories 
""The statement ticked most of the expected boxes but whether Hunt's plans can lift UK growth as he intends remains to be seen. What is clear from the numbers is that the UK’s overall fiscal position remains weak and there is little margin for the government to negotiate unexpected developments,"" he said.
The broader market turmoil induced by the failure of three U.S. lenders in the last week has been compounded by the issues at Credit Suisse and muddied the outlook for monetary policy.
Traders had already attached a strong chance the Bank of England (BoE) would leave UK rates unchanged when it meets next week, with the possibility of a rise of just 25 basis points (bps). That probability is now split 50/50, according to Refinitiv data.
""Sterling markets will continue to digest yesterday’s Budget delivered by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt as well as the broader global environment. Markets remain ambivalent whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates next week,"" said Hann-Ju Ho, senior Economist, Commercial Banking at Lloyds Bank.
The European Central Bank (ECB), meanwhile, is a little behind the BoE in its quest to fight inflation. Traders attach a 60% chance of the ECB raising rates by 50 bps on Thursday, with a 40% chance of 25 bps.
Money markets show investors expect ECB rates to peak around 3% later this year, compared with a peak of 4% just over a week ago. The BoE, meanwhile, could well leave rates where they are at 4%, compared with expectations last week for a peak of closer to 4.8%. ,
With so much investor anxiety centred on the health of banks right now, in addition to a steer on the rate outlook, ECB President Christine Lagarde could be under pressure to signal what the central bank is prepared to do to offer support.
""If the early morning rally reverses, or the markets take fright post-ECB, it’s possible that we may get a joint statement from the world’s major central banks later in the day stressing their commitment to being a lender of last resort and maintaining global liquidity through FX swap lines,"" Capital Economics said in a note.

Markets,/markets/rates-bonds/,"Investors shun high-yield bonds on recession, banking risks",Patturaja Murugaboopathy,2023-03-16 11:43:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LMSZJIPQJFNMDGSLXDGDJAPQV4.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - Global investors have resumed their selling of high-yield corporate bonds after a brief respite in January, as fears over the health of smaller banks add to risk aversion driven by worries over rising interest rates, recession and defaults.
Concerns have been heightened by the wild swings in market interest rates since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) last week.
Fund managers advise shunning high-yield bonds, despite their attractive yields, because of the risk these bonds could be hit by ratings downgrades, defaults and a squeeze in company earnings.
""Market concerns are elevated, given the uncertainty of a recession this year, the path of inflation, and most recently, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank,"" said Jim Smigiel, chief investment officer (CIO) at investment firm SEI.
""Given the volatility of the past few days and the still unfolding situation within financials, the turmoil in the banking sector could certainly increase outflows and further test the system.""

The demand for high-yield bonds has faltered since February due to a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, as strong economic activity bolstered expectations that inflation would remain sticky and the Federal Reserve would have to raise interest rates more to contain it.
Refinitiv Lipper data showed high-yield bond funds, after seeing an inflow of $7.63 billion in January, faced an outflow of $11.51 billion in February.
So far this month, high-yield bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a total outflow of $506 million.
However, safer money market funds have attracted $28.76 billion, and government bond funds have seen an inflow of $15.52 billion since February.
The ICE BofA Global high-yield bond index (.MERHW00) has fallen over 3% since the start of February, making the yields attractive at 8.7%.
The yield spread between the BofA high-yield bond index and the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond has risen to more than 500 basis points for the first time since October.
Still, the spread is tighter than the 2,090 basis points during the 2008 financial crisis and about 1,000 basis points in 2020 when the coronavirus crisis hit.
""Investors should look to reduce exposure to the U.S. high yield market at this time because we expect there will be a better entry level in the near future,"" said David Norris, head of U.S. Credit at TwentyFour Asset Management.
""Once we can be sure that the Fed has reached or is close to reaching the terminal rate, with the potential for a soft to softish landing, investors at that point could begin to increase exposure to high yield.""
""In the meantime, investors should stay invested but move up the credit spectrum to higher-rated bonds in more defensive sectors, keeping a lower duration profile.""
According to Fitch Ratings, the trailing 12-month U.S. high-yield default rate stood at 1.6% in February, the highest since June 2020. The credit rating agency also says default rates are poised to rise toward the historical average of 3.6%.
Deutsche Bank predicts higher risks of defaults this year in European high-yield corporate debt as they are increasingly vulnerable to the slowing global economy.
""There's a huge wall of debt that is going to be maturing in 2024 to 2026 that is going to be resetting at much higher interest rates than where it is fixed today,"" said Christopher Zook, CIO of CAZ Investments.
""And so there's a lot of concern that there's going to be a very significant increase in borrowing costs for these companies that are going to have to refinance in 2024-2026.""

SVB Financial's (SIVB.O) sudden shutdown on Friday after a failed capital raise had investors worried about risks to other banks from the Fed's sharp rate hikes over the last year. But many speculated the central bank could now become less hawkish, and the yield on the 2-year Treasury tumbled.
Regulators over the weekend stepped in to restore investor confidence in the banking system, saying SVB's depositors will have access to their funds on Monday.
To some investors, the Fed's decision next week will also hinge on inflation data due this week.
""If we get shockingly bad Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index, the Fed is going to find itself in a tough spot or a much tougher spot that it even finds itself in ahead of those prints,"" said Orion Advisor Solutions CIO Timothy Holland.

""Canada needs more competition. And Canadians need a modern and effective competition law to support that,"" the Competition Bureau said in a statement.
Canadians have been left with fewer and pricier choices in everything from telecoms to banking after decades of industry consolidation, consumer advocates say. Soaring inflation has worsened the issue of affordability.
The bureau's recommendations are aimed at improving merger evaluations, tackling deceptive marketing and conducting market studies, among other goals.
The watchdog said merger review rules were weak and need to be significantly re-tooled ""to address issues with market concentration and harm to the public interest in competition.""

The company's efforts to expand its portfolio of music labels and fan community platforms come after HYBE on Sunday withdrew its plan to take over rival label SM Entertainment (041510.KQ) after a weeks-long battle with social media giant Kakao (035720.KS).

HYBE owns multiple subsidiary labels and management companies including Ithaca Holdings, boasting a range of artists including BTS, Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber. It also operates Weverse, a fan community platform where artists upload exclusive content to communicate with fans.

Despite a rise in spending per person among K-pop fans, Bang said the growth in popularity of one of South Korea's most popular cultural exports was slowing in some Southeast Asian countries in particular.
The slowdown was largely, but not exclusively, due to the absence of BTS, who are currently on a break as a group, he said.
""Without BTS, the market drastically shrinks in size,"" Bang added.
Bang declined to comment on details of a new partnership deal with Kakao Entertainment on fan platform businesses, but added he was ""personally satisfied"" with the arrangement despite losing the bid to acquire SM Entertainment.

The cereal business – home to brands including Kellogg's, Froot Loops and Rice Krispies – will be named ""WK Kellogg Co,"" after company founder W.K. Kellogg, who created Corn Flakes in 1894.
While the company names will change upon the spin-off, which Kellogg intends to complete by the end of this year, the ""Kellogg's"" brand will remain on the packaging of both companies' products around the world.

Kellanova will house the MorningStar Farms label, along with Pringles, Cheez-It, Pop-Tarts and other snack brands. The business will also oversee international cereal brands including Frosties, Zucaritas, and Miel Pops.
Kellogg topped market expectations for sales and profit in the fourth quarter, as demand for its cereals and snacks remained strong even after several rounds of price increases.

The Federal Reserve is considering tougher rules and oversight for midsize banks similar in size to Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed suddenly last week.

Markets,/markets/europe/,Maersk to slow pace of ships to save fuel as demand loses steam,Jacob Gronholt-pedersen,2022-09-29 17:33:00+00:00,,"COPENHAGEN, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) will begin to slow the pace of its container ships to lower fuel costs after sailing at full speed to keep up with demand during the pandemic, its chief executive said on Thursday.
Copenhagen-based Maersk, a barometer for global trade, expects ocean freight volumes to be flat or lower this year, its CEO Soren Skou said in a Reuters Newsmaker interview, pointing to U.S. consumers buying less and confidence dented by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
As one of the world's biggest shipping companies, Maersk benefited from soaring freight rates following a surge in consumer demand during the pandemic which led to jams at ports.
Skou said freight rates have this year started falling though congestion persists in ports and global supply chains.
""We still see areas where we have ships waiting outside ports, lack of labor, and strike action, in particular in Europe. So the situation is not normalized yet, but it's clearly getting better,"" Skou said.

The company, which operates some 730 container ships, handles shipping and logistics for retailers and consumer companies such as Walmart, Nike and Unilever.
""Our ships have been going all out on speed in order to catch up as many delays as possible,"" he said.
""But as things normalize, we should expect ships to come down to normal cruise speeds. This is really important for our fuel efficiency,"" said Skou, referring to soaring fuel costs.
He expects a ""modest"" pick-up in trade for the upcoming holidays this year amid concerns about the slowing global economy and consumer demand, although volumes headed into the Christmas season were lower than in a normal year.
Freight rates remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Maersk has raised its 2022 profit guidance twice this year as they persisted longer than expected.

The Swiss bank's announcement that it would make use of a $54-billion loan from the Swiss National Bank helped stem heavy selling in financial markets in Asia on Thursday and prompted a modest rally in European equities.
While many in the market cheered the news, others were cautious. JPMorgan analysts said the loan from the SNB would not be enough to soothe investor concerns and the ""status quo was no longer an option"", leaving a takeover of Credit Suisse as the most likely outcome.
The collapse of two regional U.S. lenders in the last week has raised concern among investors and bank customers about the resilience of the financial system in the face of rising global interest rates.

Credit Suisse has seen a steady stream of withdrawals from wealthy clients, which Luis Arenzana, founder of Shelter Island Capital Management, told Reuters was not ""necessarily a panicky reaction to recent events in the U.S. alone"".
""CS has not earned its cost of equity since 2013. The bank has lost a cumulative 2.5 francs per share since. This is not the result of just one or two big one offs as the bank reported a loss for five out of nine of those years,"" Arenzana said.
Credit Suisse shares surged by as much as 32% in the first few minutes of trade on news of the lifeline, and were last up 24% in heavy volume, reversing some of the losses that stripped off a quarter of its market value the day before. Shares were changing hands at a rate of 33.27 million per hour, the fastest on record, according to Refinitiv data.
The bank's shares fell 24% on Wednesday after its biggest backer said it could not offer any more financial assistance for regulatory reasons.
In its statement early on Thursday, Credit Suisse said it would exercise an option to borrow from the central bank up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion).
That followed assurances from Swiss authorities on Wednesday that Credit Suisse met ""the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks"" and that it could access central bank liquidity if needed.
""Following yesterday's extreme share price volatility, Swiss authorities offered their support. This is a strong and important signal. We hope the measures will calm down markets and break the negative spiral,"" Bank Vontobel equity strategist Andreas Venditti said.
""However, it will take time to fully regain trust in the franchise,"" Venditti said.
The Swiss franc was last up 0.5% against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, having fallen by 2.2% on Wednesday, marking its biggest one-day drop since the central bank loosened its currency peg in early 2015.
The cost of insuring against the risk of default on Credit Suisse bonds, which on Wednesday blew out to distressed levels, fell sharply on Thursday.
Analysts at JPMorgan said in a note that a takeover was the most likely scenario for Credit Suisse, especially by rival UBS .
""We see SNB liquidity support as indicated last night as not enough and believe CSG’s situation is about ongoing market confidence issues with its IB strategy and ongoing franchise erosion,"" JPMorgan said.
""In our view, the status quo is no longer an option as counterparty concerns are starting to emerge as reflected by credit/equity market weakness,"" they said.
The value of Credit Suisse's bonds rose sharply. The bank's additional tier 1 dollar-denominated bonds were up around 8.4 cents , having plummeted below 50 cents on the dollar the day before.
""Credit Suisse is the first major bank, deemed too big to fail, to take up the offer of an emergency lifeline,"" Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
""The $54 billion rescue wad is staunching worries about a bigger run on Credit Suisse and the repercussions for other institutions around the world exposed to its operations,"" she added.
Shares in other major European banks were mixed, with France's BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) up 0.9% while those in Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Germany's Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) fell 1.2% and 0.3%, respectively. French bank shares, in particular, were hit hard on Wednesday, posting their largest one-day drops since the depths of the COVID crisis three years ago.

Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Thursday that net employment rose 64,600 in February from January, when they fell a revised 10,900. Market forecasts had been for a rebound of 48,500.
The jobless rate dropped to 3.5%, from 3.7%, when analysts had looked for a dip to 3.6%, while hours worked jumped by 3.9% in another signal of resilience. Full-time employment soared by 74,900 jobs in February, compared with a drop of 43,300 the previous month.
However, the robust data was overshadowed by global events overnight, with turmoil at Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) reigniting fear that any tightening in lending conditions would hasten a global recession. That prompted investors to price out any chance of another rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The local dollar were little moved at $0.6635 after the strong jobs data, while three-year bond futures held at 97.19, the highest since early August.
While investors are overwhelmingly leaning towards a pause in rate hikes in April, they have also priced in an around 10% chance the RBA could actually cut its 3.60% cash rate by 25 basis points. Rates were seen falling to 3.35% by August, a radical change from a month ago when investors had expected them to peak at 4.10%.
Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics, said the strength in February was due to a higher than usual number of people transitioning back into employment, as they left the workforce in January.
""While underlying employment growth has slowed down compared with what we saw through much of 2022, it is still increasing at close to its long-term historical rate,"" said Jarvis.

They sold financially themed shares and banks for nine straight weeks but rather than only exiting long positions, funds added bearish bets, according to the note seen by Reuters.
Financials was the most net sold sector globally for Goldman Sachs's prime brokerage division, the part of the bank which serves hedge funds, the note said.
World equities fell on Monday and European stocks were set for their worst day in almost three months (.STOXX). Banking shares slid further even after U.S. authorities stepped in to cap the fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB).
Hedge funds not only exited bullish positions on bank themed equities, they added short positions as of Friday, betting bank shares would fall, the Goldman note said.

Many speculators exited bank stocks entirely and the net exposure to U.S. banks sits at its lowest level since September 2021, the note said.
BlueBay Asset Management chief investment officer Mark Dowding said big moves in banks stocks on Monday could be explained by hedge funds appearing to have been positioned short at shorter-dated bank bonds.
""We have seen an event in the U.S. that went from a single A rated bank having bonds worth next to nothing in a short space of time, so against that backdrop, that has an effect that is translated on a more widespread basis,"" he said.

Cosimo Marasciulo, head of fixed income absolute return at Amundi, said falling market gauges of inflation expectations, equity market volatility and a deepening yield curve inversion after hawkish comments by Fed boss Jerome Powell showed the concern about a possible policy error.
Strong data prints suggesting inflation will be harder to bring down than hoped for have sharply raised market bets on where rate hikes by the Fed and peers this year will end.
Powell this week said the Fed will likely need to raise rates more than expected and that its March 22 decision hinges on upcoming economic data, prompting markets to bet a 50 basis-point rate hike is more likely than a 25 bps move.
View 2 more stories 
""We are maybe very short term in an era in which the market is not convinced about this higher terminal rate, so that's something interesting to watch,"" said Marasciulo at Amundi, which oversees just over $2 trillion worth of assets.
""It's like, the market feels that this push from the Fed might be too much compared to the risk of recession later on during the year.""
Marasciulo said bond market valuations looked better than a month ago after a sell-off that has seen benchmark U.S. and German government bond yields rise around 40 bps since February started.
""It's more likely that (the ECB) will do less rather than doing more,"" relative to the rate hike expectations priced by money markets, he said, adding he shared a similar view for the Fed.
Near-term, Marasciulo said it made sense to bet against the market consensus, by favouring a 25 bps move from the Fed, through trades favouring a steepening of the U.S. yield curve.
On the Bank of Japan, which meets on Friday for the last time under outgoing governor Haruhiko Kuroda, Marasciulo said an end to yield curve control is ""very likely"". He did not specify a timing.
""That tool is clearly not a tool that the new BOJ governor wants to keep. And secondly, that we see genuine upward pressure on Japanese inflation,"" he said.
""So some sort of reaction function from the BOJ would tell us that probably the yield curve control should be the first thing to be reconsidered.""
A termination of yield curve control, which has helped pin down Japanese government bond yields, would steepen global yield curves by raising risk premiums on bonds overall, Marasciulo added.

Technology,/world/europe/,"Factbox: TikTok's Chinese ownership, security concerns spark bans across nations",Reuters,2023-03-16 04:25:00+00:00,,"March 15 (Reuters) - The Biden administration has demanded that TikTok's Chinese owners divest their stakes in the popular video app or face a possible U.S. ban, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.
The move follows the introduction of a new U.S. legislation that would allow the White House to ban TikTok or other foreign-based technologies if they pose a national security risk.
Other countries and entities have also elected to ban the app.
TikTok is owned by China-based ByteDance, the world's most valuable start-up. Numerous countries have raised concerns over its proximity to the Chinese government and hold over user data across the world.
Here is a list of countries and entities that have implemented a partial or complete ban on TikTok:
India
Banned TikTok and dozens of other apps by Chinese developers on all devices in June 2020, claiming that they were potentially harmful to the country's security and integrity.

Afghanistan
Is in talks to ban TikTok and video game PUBG, with the Taliban claiming those were leading Afghan youths ""astray.""
Pakistan
Banned TikTok at least four times, with the latest ban ending in November, over what the government said was immoral and indecent content on the app.
Belgium
Belgian federal government employees will no longer be allowed to use TikTokon their work phones, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said on March 10.
Canada
The nation has banned TikTok on government-issued devices due to security risks.
Taiwan
Banned TikTok and some other Chinese apps on state-owned devices and in December 2022 launched a probe into the social media app over suspected illegal operations on the island
United States
The U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a powerful national security body, in 2020 unanimously recommended ByteDance divest TikTok because of fears that user data could be passed on to China's government.
In early March, legislators from both major U.S. parties introduced a bill to ban the popular app in the United States.
Congress previously passed a bill in December 2022 to ban TikTok on federal devices.
U.S. Educational Institutions
Boise State University, University of Oklahoma, University of Texas-Austin, and West Texas A&M University are some of the schools to ban TikTok on university devices and Wi-Fi networks.
U.S. States
Texas, Maryland, Alabama and Utah are among over 25 states that have issued orders to staff against using TikTok on government devices.
European Commission and European Parliament
The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, has issued an order to ban the use of popular Chinese app TikTok on its staff's phones due to cybersecurity concerns. Separately, the European Parliament also banned the app from staff phones.

Technology,/technology/abb-invests-us-robot-factory-reshoring-trend-hots-up-2023-03-16/,ABB invests in US robot factory as reshoring trend hots up,John Revill,2023-03-16 11:08:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YQ2SKFVARNINVAOEZED5HQLPTQ.jpg,"ZURICH, March 15 (Reuters) - ABB (ABBN.S) is expanding its main US robot factory as its customers there in the automotive, packaging and machinery industries confront a tight labour market as they bring production back home.
The Swiss engineering company, which competes with Japan's FANUC (6954.T) and Germany's Kuka (KUKAF.PK), is spending $20 million boosting capacity at its Auburn Hills site in Michigan to meet demand spurred by the Biden administration's massive industrial stimulus package.
The United States is the third largest in the global robotics market, which is worth around $50 billion per year according to estimates by ABB and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
Rapid growth is expected as US companies bring production closer to home to avoid logistic log jams which have gummed up supply chains since the global pandemic.
""After the most intense shocks to the industry, including COVID, the semi conductor shortage, and then the Ukraine war, businesses all want to become more resilient,"" said Sami Atiya, the head of ABB's Robotics and Discrete Automation division.
View 2 more stories 
""In terms of critical parts of long supply chains, the more production you can bring closer to your home, the more resilient you become,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
A survey by ABB last year showed 70% of North American businesses suffered supply chain disruptions in the last year.
As a result 37% of businesses wanted to bring their businesses back to the United States, while 33% were looking at near shoring - bringing it closer to the country.
A tight labour market and rising wages make robots more attractive.
""There is a huge shortage of skilled labour in the U.S,"" said Atiya. ""With an aging population, that gap is widening.""
Robots were now easier to use, making them attractive to smaller and medium sized business like bakeries, he added.
The IFR expects the numbers of industrial robots installed each year in the Americas to expand by an average of 8% per year over the next three years, much faster than Europe which will see growth at 1%.
China and Japan, the two biggest markets for robots, will grow at around 8%, IFR said.
""The U.S. market is particularly interesting because it is more open to foreign businesses because it does not have its own domestic brands,"" said IFR general secretary Susanne Bieller.
""That’s different to China where they are trying to develop their own and Japan which is dominated by its own players.""
The Biden Administration's $430 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which includes major provisions to cut carbon emission, boost domestic production and manufacturing, was not a direct factor behind ABB's investment, the executive said.
Still, the act, along with the $52 billion semiconductor manufacturing program, could boost demand.
Companies like Siemens and Audi have spoken about large investments in the United States on the back of the Biden stimulus, while chip manufacturers like IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Micron (MU.O) have also announced new production sites.
""The potential for growth in the industrial robots market is huge,"" Atiya said. ""We see double digit growth for the U.S. market over the next few years and don't see any reason why this will change.""

Artificial intelligence has been touted as a great disruptor in recent months. ChatGPT, a text-based chatbot developed by OpenAI that can draft prose, poetry or even computer code on command, has gained widespread attention in Silicon Valley, spurring investors to pour money into AI-focused startups.
On Feb. 17, AI came for the DJ.
""Algorhythm"" - hosted in The Glove That Fits bar – was billed as one of the first of its kind by its promoter George Pinnegar.
""If we can have AI make beautiful music and we can play that to each other, I think that's probably why it's there. That’s why it's a gift,"" Pinnegar told Reuters.
Powering the night’s pulsating techno and rhythmic drumbeat was Mubert, the app created by a team of Ukrainian and Russian developers.

Mubert uses human-made loops and samples to generate brand-new tracks. Users can like or dislike the app's generative music, and the app adapts accordingly.
Musicians who created the samples then get a cut when their sounds are used.
For Mubert’s CEO, Paul Zgordan, the rise of AI will inevitably result in some musicians losing jobs.
""We want to save musicians' jobs, but in our own way,"" Zgordan told Reuters via videolink from the Armenian capital Yerevan.
""We want to give them this opportunity to earn money with the AI. We want to give people new (jobs),” the 35-year-old executive, who is also a DJ and musician, said.
The DJ booth, usually the focus of parties, was left empty as an experiment to see how revellers would react to the AI DJ.
A few hours into the night, some of the revellers had made up their minds.
""It could be more complex,"" said Rose Cuthbertson, a 24-year-old AI master's student. ""It doesn't have that knowledge of maybe other electronic genres that could make the music more interesting. But it's still fun to dance to.""
Taking a break from dancing, Pietro Capece Galeota was more complimentary.
""It's been doing a pretty good job so far,"" the 26-year-old computer programmer said outside the venue.
Yet for Zgordan, there's more work to be done if Mubert wants to have similar functionalities to ChatGPT.
""There is no ChatGPT for music because music is more complex,"" he said. ""For now technology is not ready.""

Technology,/technology/white-house-gives-agencies-30-days-impose-federal-device-tiktok-ban-2023-02-27/,Exclusive: White House sets deadline for purging TikTok from federal devices,David Shepardson,2023-02-28 11:28:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The White House on Monday gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they do not have Chinese-owned app TikTok on federal devices and systems.
In a bid to keep U.S. data safe, all federal agencies must eliminate TikTok from phones and systems and prohibit internet traffic from reaching the company, Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told agencies in a guidance memorandum seen by Reuters.
The ban, ordered by Congress late last year, follows similar actions from Canada, the EU, Taiwan and more than half of U.S. states.
The device ban — while impacting a tiny portion of TikTok's U.S. user base — adds fuel to calls for an outright ban on the video-sharing app. National security concerns about China surged in recent weeks after a Chinese balloon drifted over the U.S.
ByteDance-owned TikTok has said the concerns are fueled by misinformation and has denied using the app to spy on Americans. The action does not affect the more than 100 million Americans who use TikTok on private or company-owned devices. TikTok did not immediately comment on the White House memo.

Congress in December voted to bar federal employees from using the Chinese-owned video app on government-owned devices and gave the Biden administration 60 days to issue agency directives. The vote was the latest action by U.S. lawmakers to crack down on Chinese companies amid national security fears that Beijing could use them to spy on Americans.
Federal Chief Information Security Officer Chris DeRusha said ""this guidance is part of the Administration’s ongoing commitment to securing our digital infrastructure and protecting the American people’s security and privacy.""
Many government agencies including the White House, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department had banned TikTok from government devices before the vote.
The TikTok ban does not apply if there are national security, law enforcement or security research activities but agency leadership must approve these activities, Young's memo said and ""blanket exceptions applying to an entire agency are not permitted.""
On Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee is set to vote on a bill that would give President Joe Biden the authority to ban TikTok from all U.S. devices.
""My bill empowers the administration to ban TikTok or any software applications that threaten U.S. national security,"" Representative Mike McCaul, the committee chair, said. ""Anyone with TikTok downloaded on their device has given the (Chinese Communist Party) a backdoor to all their personal information. It’s a spy balloon into your their phone.""
The American Civil Liberties Union said it opposed a congressional ban on TikTok.
The White House memo said within 90 days, agencies must address any use of TikTok by IT vendors through contracts and with 120 days agencies will include a new prohibition on TikTok in all new solicitations.
Earlier on Monday, Canada announced a ban on TikTok from government-issued devices, saying it presents an ""unacceptable"" level of risk to privacy and security, adding to the growing rift between the two countries.
The Canadian ban was issued ""without citing any specific security concern or contacting us with questions,"" a TikTok spokesperson said.
The European Union's two biggest policy-making institutions last week banned TikTok from staff phones for cybersecurity reasons.

The report, authored by the tech giant’s cyber security research and analysis team, outlines a series of new discoveries about how Russian hackers have operated during the Ukraine conflict and what may come next.
“Since January 2023, Microsoft has observed Russian cyber threat activity adjusting to boost destructive and intelligence gathering capacity on Ukraine and its partners’ civilian and military assets,” the report reads. One group “appears to be preparing for a renewed destructive campaign.”
The findings come as Russia has been introducing new troops to the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, according to Western security officials. Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov last month warned that Russia could accelerate its military activities surrounding the Feb. 24 anniversary of its invasion.

The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Experts say the tactic of combining physical military operations with cyber techniques mirrors prior Russian activity.
""Pairing kinetic attacks with efforts to disrupt or deny defenders’ ability to coordinate and to use cyber-dependent technology is not a new strategic approach,"" said Emma Schroeder, associate director of the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative.
Microsoft found that a particularly sophisticated Russian hacking team, known within the cyber security research community as Sandworm, was testing “additional ransomware-style capabilities that could be used in destructive attacks on organizations outside Ukraine that serve key functions in Ukraine’s supply lines.”
A ransomware attack typically involves hackers penetrating an organization, encrypting their data and extorting them for payment to regain access. Historically, ransomware has also been used as cover for more malicious cyber activity, including so-called wipers that simply destroy data.
Since January 2022, Microsoft said it had discovered at least nine different wipers and two types of ransomware variants used against more than 100 Ukrainian organizations.
These developments have been paired with a growth in more stealthy Russian cyber operations designed to directly compromise organizations in countries allied to Ukraine, according to the report.
""In nations throughout the Americas and Europe, especially Ukraine’s neighbors, Russian threat actors have sought access to government and commercial organizations involved in efforts to support Ukraine,"" said Clint Watts, general manager for Microsoft's Digital Threat Analysis Center.

The U.S. chipmaker is pleading its case in the General Court, Europe's second-highest, after winning its fight to overturn a 997-million-euro EU antitrust fine in another case there last year

The EU competition enforcer said an analysis of Qualcomm's prices showed it sold some of its chips below cost to Huawei (HWT.UL) and ZTE (000063.SZ), with rebates and discounts driving the final prices down.

Qualcomm's lawyer rebuffed the analysis on the second day of a three-day hearing.
""The Commission should have applied the price cost test over a longer, more meaningful period. Had the Commission made those two simple corrections, you would have found no predation,"" Athina Kontasakou told the court.
She said the Commission was wrong to treat annual lump-sum payments made by Qualcomm to customers as hidden discounts and rebate payments.
Martin Farley, a lawyer for the Commission, defended its analysis of Qualcomm's prices as ""fundamentally correct and robust"".
""All of the decisions that the Commission took in exercise of its discretion to calculate the costs were done to ensure that they reflected reality,"" he told judges.
The court will rule in the coming months. The case is T-671/19 Qualcomm v Commission.

The European Commission in its 2017 decision said a Luxembourg tax arrangement allowing Amazon to channel profits to a holding company tax-free meant it paid no taxes on almost three-quarters of its profits from EU operations, in essence amounting to illegal state aid.
The U.S. online retailer challenged the EU tax order in a lower tribunal, convincing it to scrap it in 2021, in a setback to competition chief Margrethe Vestager's crackdown on preferential deals.
The Commission subsequently appealed to Europe's highest court, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
""The Commission relies heavily on atmospherics to paint Amazon in a negative light and justify its decision. It claims the decision is about tax structuring and tax dodging. But it is not,"" Amazon lawyer Michel Petite told the CJEU.

He said the EU executive's appeal lacked merit as it used the wrong reference framework to determine whether Amazon had a selective advantage, citing the CJEU's judgment last year on Fiat's tax case which said such a framework should take into account national laws.
Petite also faulted the Commission on its concept of transfer pricing, which are prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries.
""The most striking illustration of the Commission's made-up transfer pricing is perhaps the fact that it relies on a concocted compilation of different versions of the OECD Guidelines, spanning a period of more than 20 years,"" he said.
Commission lawyer Paul-John Loewenthal said it was clear that Amazon's Luxembourg tax deal constituted state aid.
""Luxembourg provided a measure to Amazon by which Amazon could exempt the vast majority of its European profit from taxation in return for investments in Luxembourg, thus affecting intra-EU trade and distorting competition,"" he said.
""That is the very definition of fiscal state aid.""
Vestager's crackdown has already forced Belgium, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to change their tax practices.
The CJEU adviser will deliver a non-binding opinion on June 8, with a judgment due in the coming months. The case is C-457/21 P Commission v Luxembourg and Others.

Circle's announcement comes after the U.S. administration on Sunday stepped in with series of emergency measures to shore up confidence after failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) and New York-based Signature Bank threatened to trigger a systemic crisis.
Circle said it did not have any Stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) cash reserves at Signature Bank and that the token remained redeemable at 1:1 U.S. dollar peg.
Further, the crypto firm announced an automated USDC minting and redemption through Cross River Bank, effective Monday, and said its expanded relationships also include USDC redemptions via BNY Mellon (BK.N).
""Circle's USDC operations will open for business, including with new automated settlement via our new partnership with Cross River Bank,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Allaire said in a tweet.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a constant exchange rate with ""fiat"" currencies - those backed by a central government rather than a physical commodity such as gold - for example through a 1:1 U.S. dollar peg. USDC is the second-biggest stablecoin with a market cap of $37 billion.
USDC lost its dollar peg and slumped to an all-time low on Saturday before recovering most of its losses when Circle assured investors it would honor the peg despite exposure to failed Silicon Valley Bank.

Shares in Silvergate plunged more than 35% to $3.17, a day after hitting a record low and have lost 64% since March 1 when the company flagged a going concern risk.
Analysts said a complete closure of the crypto lender could take one or two years depending on how quickly outstanding loans are repaid and assets are disposed of.
Silvergate's latest move adds to a list of high-profile collapses among crypto market players since last year.
""We believe this decision was made, at least in part, to help mitigate Silvergate Bank's legal liability related to FTX's bankruptcy,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.
View 2 more stories 
Silvergate did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the analysts' view.
Meanwhile, shorting in the shares of Silvergate has proved profitable for bearish investors as its shares have lost 95% of their value in the past 12 months and 72% so far this year.
Nearly 85% of the company's free float is under short position with short sellers making $241 million in year-to-date mark-to-market profit, according to analytics firm S3 Partners.
While Silvergate said its liquidation plan includes a full repayment of all deposits, many within the crypto industry were still left wondering how the bank's demise would impact other firms.
""As the situation continues to unfold, we’ll have to closely monitor whether exchanges can smoothly transition from Silvergate and whether Silvergate truly is sufficiently capitalized,"" said Eric Chen, the chief executive officer and co-founder of Injective Labs, a company focused on decentralized finance.
Shares of peer Signature Bank (SBNY.O), which has been pivoting away from crypto since late last year, fell more than 11%. The S&P 500 bank index(.SPXBK) tumbled nearly 6% on Thursday.
In its second mid-quarter update this month, Signature said digital assets accounted for just 18.5% of its total deposit balance.
Crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN.O), which cut ties with Silvergate last week, dipped more than 7%. Miners Riot Blockchain (RIOT.O) fell more than 11% and Marathon Digital (MARA.O) slid 10% .
Bitcoin was last trading at $20,754, near its lowest level since January, with analysts and investors saying the market impact of the news was limited as it was widely expected.

Technology,/technology/us-threatens-tiktok-ban-if-chinese-owners-dont-sell-stake-wsj-2023-03-15/,TikTok says US threatens ban if Chinese owners don't sell stakes,Echo Wang,2023-03-16 09:52:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Biden administration has demanded that TikTok's Chinese owners divest their stakes in the popular video app or face a possible U.S. ban, the company told Reuters on Wednesday.
The move is the most dramatic in a series of recent steps by U.S. officials and legislators who have raised fears that TikTok's U.S. user data could be passed on to China's government. ByteDance-owned TikTok has more than 100 million U.S. users.
It is also the first time under the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden that a potential ban on TikTok has been threatened. Biden's predecessor, Republican Donald Trump, had tried to ban TikTok in 2020 but was blocked by U.S. courts.
TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told Reuters that the company had recently heard from the U.S. Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which demanded that the Chinese owners of the app sell their shares, and said otherwise they would face a possible U.S. ban of the video app.
View 2 more stories 
The Wall Street Journal first reported the move. ByteDance confirmed that 60% of its shares are owned by global investors, 20% by employees and 20% by its founders.
China's foreign ministry responded on Thursday, saying that the United States had yet to provide evidence that TikTok threatened national security. Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a daily briefing that the United States should stop suppressing such companies.
CFIUS, a powerful national security body, had unanimously recommended in 2020 that ByteDance divest TikTok. Under pressure from then-President Trump, ByteDance in late 2020 unsuccessfully sought to finalize a deal with Walmart and Oracle Corp to shift TikTok's U.S. assets into a new entity.
""If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,"" Tiktok's Oberwetter said in a statement.
The White House declined to comment.
TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew is due to appear before the U.S. Congress next week. It is not clear if the Chinese government would approve any divestiture and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, the White House gave government agencies 30 days to ensure they do not have TikTok on federal devices and systems. More than 30 U.S. states have also banned employees from using TikTok on government-owned devices.
Any U.S. ban would face significant legal hurdles and potential political ramifications, since TikTok is popular with millions of young Americans.
Last week, Democratic Senator Mark Warner said it was important the U.S. government do more to make clear what it believes are the national security risks from TikTok. ""It's going to be incumbent on the government to show its cards in terms of how this is a threat,"" Warner said.
TikTok and CFIUS have been negotiating for more than two years on data security requirements. TikTok said it has spent more than $1.5 billion on rigorous data security efforts and rejects spying allegations.
TikTok said on Wednesday that ""the best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, U.S.-based protection of U.S. user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification.""
Last week, the White House backed legislation by a dozen senators to give the administration new powers to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies if they pose national security threats. It could give the Biden administration new ammunition in court if they sought to ban TikTok.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the bipartisan bill, saying it ""would strengthen our ability to address discrete risks posed by individual transactions, and systemic risks posed by certain classes of transactions involving countries of concern in sensitive technology sectors.""
The House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee this month voted along party lines on a much broader bill aimed at Tiktok, sponsored by Republican Representative Michael McCaul, that Democrats said would require the administration to effectively ban TikTok and other subsidiaries of ByteDance.

While Xbox maker Microsoft is likely to secure EU antitrust approval for acquiring Activision with such licensing deals and other behavioural remedies, it is facing headwinds in the United States and Britain.

As of Wednesday, the S&P 500 technology sector (.SPLRCT) was down 1.7% compared to a 3.6% drop for the broader benchmark stock index (.SPX) since March 8, when problems at Silicon Valley Bank set off fears of financial system contagion.

With investors ""starting to price in solvency risk or the potential of companies needing capital, the market is rewarding those that don't need capital to survive,"" he said.

The relative strength in tech, the biggest S&P 500 sector with a 28% weighting in the index, has helped take the edge off a broader decline in stocks fueled by fears that financial system disruptions and tighter monetary policy will hurt U.S. growth.
The S&P 500 was down 1.6% on Wednesday afternoon, having nearly erased its year-to-date gain as financial stability concerns spread to Europe, hammering the shares of embattled Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and other lenders.
A swift tumble in Treasury yields is also helping boost tech stocks. Tech shares were pummeled in 2022 as the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes drove up Treasury yields, hurting ""long duration"" assets such as tech stocks.
That move has reversed dramatically in recent days amid extreme volatility in the bond market. Yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries on Wednesday fell to their lowest since September.
Shares of utilities, consumer staples and healthcare - typically seen as more able to weather tough economic times - have also held up better than broader markets, though they carry a much smaller weighting in the S&P 500 than tech stocks.
The utilities sector (.SPLRCU) has climbed 1% since last Wednesday, consumer staples (.SPLRCS) has slipped 0.5%, while healthcare (.SPXHC) has dipped 1%.

Nasdaq suspended trading in the securities of a number of companies operating in Russia days after Moscow despatched tens of thousands of troops to Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.
Yandex and Ozon said they would appeal the decision. Neither company has fallen under Western sanctions, although some of Yandex's top management have.

The ""Online News Act,"" or House of Commons bill C-18, introduced in April last year laid out rules to force platforms like Meta and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to negotiate commercial deals and pay news publishers for their content.
""A legislative framework that compels us to pay for links or content that we do not post, and which are not the reason the vast majority of people use our platforms, is neither sustainable nor workable,"" a Meta spokesperson said as reason to suspend news access in the country.
Meta's move comes after Google last month started testing limited news censorship as a potential response to the bill.
Canada's news media industry has asked the government for more regulation of tech companies to allow the industry to recoup financial losses it has suffered in the years as tech giants like Google and Meta steadily gain greater market share of advertising.

In a statement on Sunday, Canadian Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez said it was disappointing to see Facebook resorting to threats instead of working with the Canadian government in good faith, and the C-18 bill had nothing to do with how Facebook makes news available to Canadians.
""All we're asking Facebook to do is negotiate fair deals with news outlets when they profit from their work,"" Rodriguez said. ""This is part of a disappointing trend this week that tech giants would rather pull news than pay their fair share.""
Facebook last year raised concerns about the legislation and warned it might be forced to block news-sharing on its platform.

Technology,/technology/exclusive-brands-blast-twitter-ads-next-child-pornography-accounts-2022-09-28/,Exclusive: Brands blast Twitter for ads next to child pornography accounts,Sheila Dang,2022-09-29 13:58:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FOHCQPSVWVOGNPELD3PSUFBQMU.jpg,"Sept 28 (Reuters) - Some major advertisers including Dyson, Mazda, Forbes and PBS Kids have suspended their marketing campaigns or removed their ads from parts of Twitter because their promotions appeared alongside tweets soliciting child pornography, the companies told Reuters.
DIRECTV and Thoughtworks also told Reuters late on Wednesday they have paused their advertising on Twitter.
Brands ranging from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N), NBCUniversal (CMCSA.O) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to a children's hospital were among more than 30 advertisers that appeared on the profile pages of Twitter accounts peddling links to the exploitative material, according to a Reuters review of accounts identified in new research about child sex abuse online from cybersecurity group Ghost Data.
Some of tweets include key words related to ""rape"" and ""teens,"" and appeared alongside promoted tweets from corporate advertisers, the Reuters review found. In one example, a promoted tweet for shoe and accessories brand Cole Haan appeared next to a tweet in which a user said they were ""trading teen/child"" content.
""We're horrified,"" David Maddocks, brand president at Cole Haan, told Reuters after being notified that the company's ads appeared alongside such tweets. ""Either Twitter is going to fix this, or we'll fix it by any means we can, which includes not buying Twitter ads.""

In another example, a user tweeted searching for content of ""Yung girls ONLY, NO Boys,"" which was immediately followed by a promoted tweet for Texas-based Scottish Rite Children's Hospital. Scottish Rite did not return multiple requests for comment.
In a statement, Twitter spokesperson Celeste Carswell said the company ""has zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation"" and is investing more resources dedicated to child safety, including hiring for new positions to write policy and implement solutions.
She added that Twitter is working closely with its advertising clients and partners to investigate and take steps to prevent the situation from happening again.
Twitter's challenges in identifying child abuse content were first reported in an investigation by tech news site The Verge in late August. The emerging pushback from advertisers that are critical to Twitter's revenue stream is reported here by Reuters for the first time.
Like all social media platforms, Twitter bans depictions of child sexual exploitation, which are illegal in most countries. But it permits adult content generally and is home to a thriving exchange of pornographic imagery, which comprises about 13% of all content on Twitter, according to an internal company document seen by Reuters.
Twitter declined to comment on the volume of adult content on the platform.
Ghost Data identified the more than 500 accounts that openly shared or requested child sexual abuse material over a 20-day period this month. Twitter failed to remove more than 70% of the accounts during the study period, according to the group, which shared the findings exclusively with Reuters.
Reuters could not independently confirm the accuracy of Ghost Data's finding in full, but reviewed dozens of accounts that remained online and were soliciting materials for ""13+"" and ""young looking nudes.""
After Reuters shared a sample of 20 accounts with Twitter last Thursday, the company removed about 300 additional accounts from the network, but more than 100 others still remained on the site the following day, according to Ghost Data and a Reuters review.
Reuters then on Monday shared the full list of more than 500 accounts after it was furnished by Ghost Data, which Twitter reviewed and permanently suspended for violating its rules, said Twitter's Carswell on Tuesday.
In an email to advertisers on Wednesday morning, ahead of the publication of this story, Twitter said it ""discovered that ads were running within Profiles that were involved with publicly selling or soliciting child sexual abuse material.""
Andrea Stroppa, the founder of Ghost Data, said the study was an attempt to assess Twitter's ability to remove the material. He said he personally funded the research after receiving a tip about the topic.
Twitter's transparency reports on its website show it suspended more than 1 million accounts last year for child sexual exploitation.
It made about 87,000 reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a government-funded non-profit that facilitates information sharing with law enforcement, according to that organization's annual report.
""Twitter needs to fix this problem ASAP, and until they do, we are going to cease any further paid activity on Twitter,"" said a spokesperson for Forbes.
""There is no place for this type of content online,"" a spokesperson for carmaker Mazda USA said in a statement to Reuters, adding that in response, the company is now prohibiting its ads from appearing on Twitter profile pages.
A Disney spokesperson called the content ""reprehensible"" and said they are ""doubling-down on our efforts to ensure that the digital platforms on which we advertise, and the media buyers we use, strengthen their efforts to prevent such errors from recurring.""
A spokesperson for Coca-Cola, which had a promoted tweet appear on an account tracked by the researchers, said it did not condone the material being associated with its brand and said ""any breach of these standards is unacceptable and taken very seriously.""
NBCUniversal said it has asked Twitter to remove the ads associated with the inappropriate content.
Twitter is hardly alone in grappling with moderation failures related to child safety online. Child welfare advocates say the number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in recent years, as predators have used social networks including Meta's Facebook and Instagram to groom victims and exchange explicit images.
For the accounts identified by Ghost Data, nearly all the traders of child sexual abuse material marketed the materials on Twitter, then instructed buyers to reach them on messaging services such as Discord and Telegram in order to complete payment and receive the files, which were stored on cloud storage services like New Zealand-based Mega and U.S.-based Dropbox, according to the group's report.
A Discord spokesperson said the company had banned one server and one user for violating its rules against sharing links or content that sexualize children.
Mega said a link referenced in the Ghost Data report was created in early August and soon after deleted by the user, which it declined to identify. Mega said it permanently closed the user's account two days later.
Dropbox and Telegram said they use a variety of tools to moderate content but did not provide additional detail on how they would respond to the report.
Still the reaction from advertisers poses a risk to Twitter's business, which earns more than 90% of its revenue by selling digital advertising placements to brands seeking to market products to the service's 237 million daily active users.
Twitter is also battling in court Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk, who is attempting to back out of a $44 billion deal to buy the social media company over complaints about the prevalence of spam accounts and its impact on the business.
A team of Twitter employees concluded in a report dated February 2021 that the company needed more investment to identify and remove child exploitation material at scale, noting the company had a backlog of cases to review for possible reporting to law enforcement.
""While the amount of (child sexual exploitation content) has grown exponentially, Twitter's investment in technologies to detect and manage the growth has not,"" according to the report, which was prepared by an internal team to provide an overview about the state of child exploitation material on Twitter and receive legal advice on the proposed strategies.
""Recent reports about Twitter provide an outdated, moment in time glance at just one aspect of our work in this space, and is not an accurate reflection of where we are today,"" Carswell said.
The traffickers often use code words such as ""cp"" for child pornography and are ""intentionally as vague as possible,"" to avoid detection, according to the internal documents. The more that Twitter cracks down on certain keywords, the more that users are nudged to use obfuscated text, which ""tend to be harder for (Twitter) to automate against,"" the documents said.
Ghost Data's Stroppa said that such tricks would complicate efforts to hunt down the materials, but noted that his small team of five researchers and no access to Twitter's internal resources was able to find hundreds of accounts within 20 days.
Twitter did not respond to a request for further comment.

The rules, expected to be announced by the year-end and with details yet to be hammered out, would establish a legal basis for controlling news dissemination on platforms like Facebook and YouTube while placing a significant moderation burden on platform providers, two of the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified, as discussions about the new rules remain confidential.
Vietnam's Ministry of Information and Communications and Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""The government wants to fix what it sees as the 'news-lisation' of social media,"" said one source familiar with the talks. ""News-lisation"", or báo hoá, is a term used by the authorities to describe the misleading of users into thinking that social media accounts are authorised news outlets.

Government officials have been holding confidential meetings with popular social media and internet firms to brief them on which types of accounts will be allowed to post news content under the new rules, according to the sources.
Authorities would be able to order social media companies to ban accounts that break those rules, they said.
Vietnam's ruling Communist Party already maintains tight media censorship and tolerates little dissent, with one of the world's most stringent internet regimes and national guidelines on social media behaviour.
Two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters that more rules on internet and social media platforms would be introduced around the fourth quarter of 2022 to early 2023.
As tech-savvy young Vietnamese increasingly turn to social media for information, those platforms have become a target for government efforts to restrict the flow of news from unauthorised sources.
Vietnam is a top-10 market globally for Facebook with 60 million to 70 million users, according to 2021 data, and sources familiar with the matter said it generates around $1 billion in annual revenue for the company – surpassing France.
YouTube has 60 million users in Vietnam and TikTok has 20 million, according to 2021 government estimates, although Twitter remains a relatively small player.
Meta Platforms Inc (META.O), owner of Facebook, and Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) declined to comment. Alphabet Inc's Google and YouTube did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok said in a statement that it addresses content violations based on applicable laws and with adherence to its guidelines, but did not comment on pending Vietnam regulations.
The Vietnamese government had adopted in July a set of non-binding guidelines on what qualifies as news outlets, including criteria to distinguish ""real"" and ""fake"" news outlets, warning that some social networking sites include accounts that mislead users into thinking they are newspapers.
Those guidelines are expected to be incorporated into the new rules, which will be binding.
The authorities are also expected to implement new rules that would require social media platforms to immediately take down content deemed to harm national security, and to remove illegal content within 24 hours, sources familiar with the matter said.
Sources told Reuters in April that the new rules, which were originally planned for July, reflected the government's dissatisfaction with social media platforms' take-down rates. read more 
This will be done through amendments to the country's main internet law.
Vietnam in August also issued a new regulation, due to come into effect from October, that will require technology firms to store users' data locally and to set up local offices.

World,/world/taiwan-warns-honduras-against-poison-aid-china-2023-03-16/,Taiwan warns Honduras against 'poison' of taking aid from China,Reuters,2023-03-16 08:19:00+00:00,,"TAIPEI, March 16 (Reuters) - Taiwan warned Honduras on Thursday not to be tempted by the ""poison"" of aid from China no matter how indebted it was and ruled out getting involved in a bidding war for diplomatic allies with its mainland rival.
Honduran President Xiomara Castro said on Tuesday she had asked her foreign minister to open official relations with China. If the Central American country does end relations with Taiwan, it would leave the island with only 13 diplomatic allies.
Honduran Foreign Minister Eduardo Enrique Reina said on Wednesday the decision to switch allegiance to China was partly because Honduras was ""up to its neck"" in financial challenges and debt - including $600 million it owes Taiwan.
""We remind the Honduran government that it should not quench its thirst with poison, even if fully parched by debt obligations,"" the Taiwan ministry said.
Reina said Honduras had asked Taiwan to double its annual aid to $100 million but never received an answer. Honduras also tried to renegotiate the debt but it came to nothing.

Taiwan denied that, saying comments from the Honduran foreign minister did not reflect facts of their communications. Taiwan responded positively to Honduras proposals from start to finish, it said.
""We're still trying to maintain diplomatic ties, doing our best to fight for it, but we will absolutely not engage in money competition with China,"" the ministry said.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said former Taiwan allies like Panama, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador have seen ""rapid development"" in bilateral relations, bringing them ""tangible benefits"".
China is willing to develop ties with all countries, including Honduras, on the basis of the ""one China"" principle, he said, referring to Beijing's position that China and Taiwan are part of one country.
""I believe this will create more opportunities for the economic development of Honduras and the well-being of its people.""
The United States, Taiwan's most important international backer despite the absence of formal ties, was watching with concern as China has increased its footprint in Latin America at the expense of Taiwan.
The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that China makes many promises it does not follow through on.
""The Honduran Government should be aware that the PRC (People's Republic of China) makes many promises that are unfulfilled,"" a State Department spokesperson said.
China does not allow countries with which it has diplomatic relations to maintain official ties with Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taiwan strongly disputes.

Admiral John Aquilino, Commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said an ""AUKUS"" partnership between Australia, Britain and the United States to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines was to boost its defence capability.
""As good partners, United States and the United Kingdom will go ahead and assist in the ability for Australia to defend themselves,"" he said after giving a lecture in Singapore, answering a question from the audience.
""We are intending to move as fast as possible. And as safe as possible.""

Putin said Russia could consider allowing some payments if the companies reinvested the proceeds back into Russia.
The restrictions were part of sweeping capital controls Russia introduced last year in response to Western sanctions on Moscow over its military campaign in Ukraine.
""I understand that this, to a certain extent, limits the possibilities for our faithful friends and partners, who have worked, are working and want to continue working,"" Putin said on Thursday.
Russia considers any country that has hit Moscow with sanctions - including the U.S., Canada, Japan and the 27 members of the European Union - to be ""unfriendly"" and has imposed a number of counter-sanctions aimed specifically at them.

""I will ask the government to ... think about a more flexible situation, in which it would be possible to pay dividends and withdraw some funds on condition that, among other things, these funds are directed, perhaps primarily, towards developing business in Russia,"" he added.
First Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov noted that current legislation does not prohibit the payment of dividends, but keeps them in special ""type-C"" accounts in roubles.
But he acknowledged that the regulations could be made clearer.
""We have investors and investment that came to Russia after the start of the special operation and after the introduction of sanctions,"" Belousov said. ""And so for this kind of investment, we propose that the restrictions we have today should be significantly eased.""
Putin was addressing business leaders in person for the first time since the day he sent his troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year. He called on Russia's business elite to invest at home and help Russia overcome the West's ""sanctions war"".
Hundreds of Western firms left Russia in a mass corporate exodus last year, often booking hefty write-downs on the value of their investments.

World,/world/netanyahu-visits-berlin-talks-crisis-festers-back-home-2023-03-16/,Netanyahu visits Berlin for talks as crisis festers back home,Andreas Rinke,2023-03-16 11:38:00+00:00,,"BERLIN, March 16 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Berlin for talks on Iran and other issues on Thursday, leaving back home a crisis over a judicial overhaul by his far-right coalition that has triggered mass protests in recent weeks.
Netanyahu met Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who is seeking to reaffirm support for Israel while also conveying German unhappiness with Netanyahu's plans. The Israeli government's drive to limit Supreme Court powers while increasing its own power in selecting judges has caused alarm at home and abroad about the country's democratic checks and balances.
Parts of Berlin were cordoned off to traffic as police geared up for protests in the German capital against the Israeli leader's visit. Netanyahu has already shortened his trip amid security concerns.
Netanyahu and Scholz jointly visited Berlin's Gleis 17, or track 17 from where more than 50,000 Jews were deported by train to the Nazi concentration camps between 1941 and 1945.
The sombre ceremony contrasted with the eruption of new protests in Israel. Flag-waving demonstrators marched through the streets and disrupted traffic, and overnight protesters painted a symbolic red line along roads to the Supreme Court.
View 2 more stories 
Netanyahu wants the meeting with Scholz to focus on efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Germany also wants to discuss the implications of last week's surprise reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Germany has already signalled its unhappiness with the planned judicial changes, which could also introduce the death penalty.
""I don't want to hide the fact that we abroad are worried about some legislative projects in Israel,"" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said at a joint press conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen in Berlin last month.
""One of the values that unites us is the protection of rule of law principles, such as the independence of the judiciary,"" she said, adding: ""We are particularly concerned about the plan to introduce the death penalty.""
Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges that he denies, says the changes will strengthen democracy and boost business. Members of his coalition driving the overhaul hope to win parliament's final approval of it by April 2.
Scholz's government wants to underscore support for Israel and Germany recognising its responsibility for the Holocaust. But Gabriela Heinrich, a senior lawmaker in Scholz's SPD party said blunt messages were needed.
""Precisely because of our deep friendship with Israel, German politicians are obliged not to mince words when it comes to concerns about the Israeli government's actions,"" Heinrich, the head of the German-Israeli parliamentary group, told Reuters.
The head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, also expressed concern over the judicial overhaul, saying that ""a dismantling of democratic structures would also not be acceptable for the Jewish community outside of Israel"".
Thursday's talks will likely touch on Germany's wish to buy the Israeli-made Arrow-3 anti-ballistic missile defence system as part of a European shield that Berlin wants to establish with other countries.
Traffic in Berlin's government district was severely restricted in the morning. Bridges over the river Spree were partially closed and guarded by armed police.

World,/world/pentagon-releases-video-black-sea-drone-incident-2023-03-16/,Pentagon releases de-classified video of Black Sea drone incident,Phil Stewart,2023-03-16 11:33:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - In a rare move, the Pentagon on Thursday released a de-classified video showing Russia's intercept of a U.S. military surveillance drone downed over the Black Sea two days ago.
It was the first direct U.S.-Russian incident since the Ukraine war began, worsening already tense relations between Washington and Moscow.
In the video, a Russian Su-27 fighter jet comes very close to the U.S. MQ-9 drone and dumps fuel near it, in what U.S. officials say was an apparent effort to damage the American aircraft as it flew over the Black Sea.
It also shows the loss of the video feed after another close Russian maneuver, which the Pentagon says resulted from the Russian jet's collision with the drone. It ends with images of the drone's damaged propeller, which the Pentagon says resulted from the collision, making the aircraft inoperable.
The video, which is about 40 seconds long, has been edited by the U.S. military for length but shows events in a sequential order, the Pentagon said.

Russia has denied U.S. accusations that its jets acted recklessly in the incident on Tuesday over the Black Sea, and instead has blamed ""sharp maneuvering"" by the drone for the crash, claiming its jet did not make contact.
The incident over international waters was a reminder of the risk of direct confrontation between the United States and Russia over Ukraine, which Moscow invaded more than a year ago and which Western allies have supported with intelligence and weapons.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russian ships had been seen near the area where the drone had crashed, though they did not appear to have recovered any parts of the drone yet. It was not clear if they were still in the area.
Washington has said that any recovery efforts relating to the drone would be difficult because of the depth of water in the region. It said it has taken measures to ensure that no sensitive information can be gleaned from the remains of the drone.
The release of the video followed separate calls on Wednesday between the top U.S. general, Mark Milley, and his Russian counterpart, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, as well as between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu.
In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, Milley said it was clear that the intercept and harassment of the drone by Russian jets was intentional, but it was unclear whether the Russian pilots meant to slam their aircraft into the drone -- a move that could also put the Russian aircraft at risk.

World,/world/no-white-house-visit-israels-netanyahu-us-concern-rises-2023-03-16/,No White House visit for Israel's Netanyahu as US concern rises,Simon Lewis,2023-03-16 09:59:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QZWS56A2FJL6LJQZ3DJXNDAXXM.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Eleven weeks into his third stint as Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to be received at the White House, signaling apparent U.S. unhappiness over the policies of his right-wing government.
Most new Israeli leaders had visited the United States or met the president by this point in their premierships, according to a Reuters review of official visits going back to the late 1970s. Only two out of 13 previous prime ministers heading a new government waited longer.
The White House declined to confirm Netanyahu has yet to be invited. A State Department spokesperson referred Reuters to the Israeli government for information about the prime minister's travel plans.
Israel’s embassy in Washington declined to comment.
""The message they clearly want to send is: If you pursue objectionable policies, there's no entitlement to the Oval Office sit-down,” said David Makovsky, a former senior adviser to the Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations, now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Since the start of the year, demonstrators have filled Israel's streets to protest the government's plan to curb the power of the Supreme Court, which critics say removes a check on the governing coalition.
Amid escalating West Bank violence, the right-wing government's action authorizing settler outposts and inflammatory comments from a member of Netanyahu's cabinet with responsibilities over Jewish settlements have drawn criticism from U.S. officials, including from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a visit to Israel last week.
U.S.-Israeli ties remain close. The United States has long been Israel’s main benefactor, sending more than $3 billion each year in military assistance.
President Joe Biden has known Netanyahu for decades, the two have spoken by phone, and senior officials in both countries have made visits since Netanyahu's government was formed in December, despite Israel's spiraling political crisis.
But the lack of a White House visit underscores both the desire of the Biden administration to see different policies in Israel and what critics say is a reluctance to take more forceful steps.
U.S. statements on events in Israel have often comprised “frustrating boiler-plate language,” said Sarah Yerkes, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who formerly worked at the State Department on policy towards Israel and the Palestinians.
“It has been frustrating to see this lack of teeth to any of the U.S. responses,” Yerkes said.
“They don't get to be treated with the same kid gloves that they've always been treated with because ... they’re on the path to not being a democracy anymore.”
The Biden administration prefers quiet conversations over public criticism, a senior State Department official said, especially when it comes to the crisis over a proposed Israeli judicial overhaul.
“Anything that we would say on the specific proposals has the potential to be deeply counterproductive,” the official said, adding the goal was to encourage Israel’s leaders to build consensus over the reforms, rather than to be prescriptive on what the outcome should be.
Chris Murphy, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he hopes the administration will persist with a clear message to Israel.
""I would certainly like to see the administration to be sending a strong signal that we have to maintain our support for a future Palestinian state and the decisions that the Netanyahu government are making now greatly compromise that future,"" Murphy said.
A separate group of 92 progressive lawmakers warned in a letter to Biden that the judicial overhaul could empower those in Israel who favor annexing the West Bank, ""undermining the prospects for a two-state solution and threatening Israel’s existence as a Jewish and democratic state.”
U.S. leaders have rarely criticized Israeli policies since Secretary of State James Baker in 1989 advised the country against moves toward annexing Palestinian territory and expanding settlements. Baker later banned Netanyahu, at the time a deputy minister of foreign affairs, from the State Department after he criticized U.S. policy toward Israel.
Biden, a Democrat who describes himself as a Zionist, says U.S. support for Israel is “ironclad.”
“Biden’s own personal instincts are such that it’s very difficult for him to want to adopt an extremely tough posture towards Israel,” Dennis Ross, a veteran U.S. Middle East peace negotiator now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
“He would prefer to have the Middle East in a box so he can focus only on Russia, Ukraine and China. Unfortunately, the Middle East has a way of imposing itself, unless we initiate enough to try to manage the environment.”

World,/world/us-seeks-allies-backing-possible-china-sanctions-over-ukraine-war-sources-2023-03-01/,Exclusive: US seeks allies' backing for possible China sanctions over Ukraine war,Trevor Hunnicutt,2023-03-01 22:13:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - The United States is sounding out close allies about the possibility of imposing new sanctions on China if Beijing provides military support to Russia for its war in Ukraine, according to four U.S. officials and other sources.
The consultations, which are still at a preliminary stage, are intended to drum up support from a range of countries, especially those in the wealthy Group of 7 (G7), to coordinate support for any possible restrictions.
It was not clear what specific sanctions Washington will propose. The conversations have not been previously disclosed.
The U.S. Treasury Department, a lead agency on the imposition of sanctions, declined to comment.
Washington and its allies have said in recent weeks that China was considering providing weapons to Russia, which Beijing denies. Aides to U.S. President Joe Biden have not publicly provided evidence.
View 2 more stories 
They have also warned China directly against doing so, including in meetings between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as during a Feb. 18 in-person meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on the sidelines of a global security conference in Munich.
The Biden administration's initial steps to counter Chinese support for Russia have included informal outreach at the staff and diplomatic levels, including the Treasury Department, sources familiar with the matter said.
They said officials were laying the groundwork for potential action against Beijing with the core group of countries that were most supportive of sanctions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine a year ago.
Asked about the consultations, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said Russia's war made it difficult for China with Europe and others.
""It's a distraction for China and a potential blow to their international relationships they do not need nor should they want,"" the spokesperson said.
One official from a country consulted by Washington said that they had only seen scant intelligence backing up the claims about China considering possible military assistance to Russia. A U.S. official, however, said they were providing detailed accounts of the intelligence to allies.
China's role in the Russia-Ukraine war is expected to be among the topics when Biden meets with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the White House on Friday. Before that in New Delhi on Wednesday and Thursday, the war will be discussed by foreign ministers from dozens of countries, including Russia, China and the United States.
Last week China issued a 12-point paper calling for a comprehensive ceasefire that was met with scepticism in the West.
The initial outreach by Washington on sanctions has not yet led to broad agreement on any specific measures, the sources said.
One source said the administration wanted to first raise the idea of coordinated sanctions and ""take pulses"" in the event that any shipments are detected to Russia from China, which declared a ""no limits"" partnership shortly before the invasion on Feb. 24 last year.
""On the G7 front, I think there is real awareness,"" a second source said, but added that detailed measures focused on China were not yet in place.
The Ukraine conflict has settled into grinding trench warfare. With Russia running low on munitions, Ukraine and its supporters fear that supplies from China could tilt the conflict to Russia's advantage.
As part of a related diplomatic push, Washington won language in a Feb. 24 G7 statement to mark the war's first anniversary that called on ""third-countries"" to ""cease providing material support to Russia's war, or face severe costs.""
Though the statement did not mention China by name, the U.S. imposed new penalties on people and companies accused of helping Russia evade sanctions. The measures included export curbs on companies in China and elsewhere that will block them from buying items, such as semiconductors.
""We've tried to signal very clearly, both in private in Munich, and then publicly, our concerns,"" Daniel Kritenbrink, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told Congress this week. ""We've talked about the implications and the consequences if they were to do so. And we also know that many of our like-minded partners share those concerns.""
Among the challenges the United States faces in putting sanctions on China, the world's second-biggest economy, is its thorough integration in the major economies of Europe and Asia, complicating the talks. U.S. allies from Germany to South Korea are reticent to alienate China.
Anthony Ruggiero, a sanctions expert under former President Donald Trump, said the Biden administration does have scope for economically restricting private actors within China and that doing so could deter the government and banks from providing further support.
""Then the administration can send messages to China in public and in private, with the latter being more explicit, that the U.S. will escalate the sanctions to include targeting Chinese banks with the full range of available options,"" said Ruggiero, now with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies group.
Washington should make China choose between access to the U.S. financial system or aiding Russia's war, Ruggiero said, citing the sanctions approach to Iran and North Korea.

World,/world/europe/,Factbox: What is the MQ-9 Reaper drone that collided with a Russian jet?,Reuters,2023-03-15 20:07:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2HAVFZHLYZNFJIJSDVTHBL7CZE.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - A Russian Su-27 fighter jet struck the propeller of a U.S. military ""Reaper"" surveillance drone on Tuesday, causing it to crash into the Black Sea in an incident condemned as ""reckless' by the U.S. military.
Below is a description of the MQ-9 ""Reaper"" drone based on information from the Air Force and its maker, General Atomics.
WHAT IT DOES AND WHO OWNS IT:
The MQ-9 ""Reaper"" unmanned aerial vehicle can loiter at up to 50,000 feet for more than 27 hours, gathering intelligence with sophisticated cameras, sensors and radars. It has a 66 foot wingspan, a Honeywell engine, can carry 3,900 pounds of fuel and travel at a speed of 240 knots 'true air speed'.
The Reaper, which was delivered to the Air Force 16 years ago, can also be equipped with weapons such as air-to-ground missiles.
MQ-9s have also been purchased by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, NASA, UK Royal Air Force, the Italian Air Force, the French Air Force and the Spanish Air Force.
Drones are generally less expensive than manned aircraft with similar capabilities, and are safer for operators since they do not require a pilot. Unlike most other aircraft, drones can loiter for hours gathering intelligence material. They cost about $3,500 per flight hour, compared to about $8,000 per flight hour to operate, for example, an F-16, according to General Atomics.

According to the Air Force, for $56.5 million they can purchase four MQ-9 aircraft with sensors, ground control station and a satellite link.
General Atomics says the MQ-9 has ""demonstrated an air-to-air weapons capability"" in Air Force tests. It can also be equipped with a ""Self Protect Pod"" that can detect threats and deploy countermeasures against surface-to-air weapons.

Below are the two accounts:
WHAT THE UNITED STATES SAID:
The United States announced on Tuesday that one of its MQ-9 ""Reaper"" intelligence and surveillance drones had been struck by a Russian Su-27 fighter. According to the U.S. Department of Defence the Russian fighter hit the drone's propeller forcing U.S. forces to bring the drone down.
""Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on, and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner,"" James B. Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe and Air Forces Africa, said.
""This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional,"" Hecker said.
The United States said the drone was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by the Russian aircraft.

WHAT RUSSIA SAID:
Russia said the MQ-9 drone was flying near Crimea - which Russia annexed in 2014 - and heading towards territories which Russia considers its own.
""As a result of sharp manoeuvring around 9.30 Moscow time, the MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle went into an uncontrolled flight with a loss of altitude and collided with the water,"" Russia's defence ministry said.
Russia said the transponders of the drone had been turned off and that fighters had been scrambled to identify it.
""Russian fighters did not use airborne weapons, did not come into contact with the unmanned aerial vehicle and returned safely to the home airfield.""
Russia's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said the drone's fight was unacceptable.
""The unacceptable actions of the United States military in the close proximity to our borders are cause for concern,"" Antonov said. ""We are well aware of the missions such reconnaissance and strike drones are used for.""
""If, for example, a Russian strike drone appeared near New York or San Francisco, how would the US Air Force and Navy react?"" Antonov asked.
He said the United States should stop flying drones so close to ""Russian borders"".
According to the U.S. air force, the Reaper is ""employed primarily as an intelligence-collection asset and secondarily against dynamic execution targets"".
""Given its significant loiter time, wide-range sensors, multi-mode communications suite, and precision weapons, it provides a unique capability to perform strike, coordination, and reconnaissance against high-value, fleeting, and time-sensitive targets,"" the air force says.

World,/world/europe/,German defence minister picks chief of territorial command for military top job,Reuters,2023-03-15 12:53:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FYXJUIXK3VMFDKJXCRMRE6VYQ4.jpg,"BERLIN, March 15 (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has named Lieutenant General Carsten Breuer as Chief of Defence, the German military's top job, in his first major staff appointment since taking office.
Breuer, currently chief of the military's territorial command, will start on Friday, taking over from Eberhard Zorn who has been in the position since 2018, the defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.
The statement did not give any reasons for the move.
Pistorius, who took office two months ago, also replaced a secretary of state, one of the highest civilian positions within the defence ministry.
Breuer led the COVID emergency task force at the chancellery in Berlin from 2021 until 2022.

World,/world/us-warns-russia-be-more-careful-downed-drone-not-recovered-white-house-2023-03-15/,Difficult to recover downed drone in Black Sea- top U.S. general,Idrees Ali,2023-03-15 21:36:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - A U.S. surveillance drone brought down over the Black Sea after a Russian military intercept probably broke apart and would be difficult to recover given the depth of the water in the area, the top U.S. general said on Wednesday.
In the first direct U.S.-Russian incident since the Ukraine war began, a Russian Su-27 jet struck the propeller of the unmanned MQ-9 drone, making it inoperable, the Pentagon said, worsening already tense relations between Washington and Moscow.
Russia's defense ministry blamed ""sharp maneuvering"" by the drone for the crash and said its jet did not make contact.
""It probably sank to some significant depths, so any recovery operation from a technical standpoint would be very difficult,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley told reporters.
He cautioned that it would take several days before the United States would know for certain the size of the debris field in waters as deep as 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1,219 to 1,524 meters), Milley said.

Russia said on Wednesday it would try to retrieve the remains the drone but appeared to acknowledge the challenges.
""I don't know whether we will be able to retrieve it or not, but that it has to be done. And we'll certainly work on it. I hope, of course, successfully,"" Kremlin Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev told the Rossiya-1 TV channel.
Milley said the United States had already taken measures to guard against a loss of sensitive intelligence if the drone were to be recovered by Russia.
""We're quite confident that whatever was of value is no longer of value,"" Milley said.
The incident over international waters on Tuesday was a reminder of the risk of direct confrontation between the United States and Russia over Ukraine, which Moscow invaded more than a year ago and which Western allies have supported with intelligence and weapons.

Milley said it was clear that the intercept and harassment of the drone by Russian jets was intentional, but it was unclear whether the Russian pilots meant to slam their aircraft into the MQ-9 -- a move that could also put the Russian aircraft at risk.
""Was it intentional or not? Don't know yet,"" Milley said.
Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the incident was likely unintentional.
""I think the best assessment right now is that it probably was unintentional. It probably was the result of profound incompetence on the part of one of these Russian pilots,"" Price said.
Milley spoke with his Russian counterpart, Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, in a rare phone call on Wednesday, the Pentagon said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, on Wednesday after the incident, but he declined to offer any details on his call at a news conference -- including whether he criticized the Russian intercept.
The restraint appeared to be an effort to preserve a rarely used U.S. communications channel with Moscow.
The State Department on Tuesday summoned Russia's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, to express U.S. concerns over the encounter.
""The message that we delivered to the Russian ambassador is that they need to be more careful in flying in international airspace near U.S. assets that are, again, flying in completely legal ways, conducting missions in support of our national security interests,"" White House spokesperson John Kirby told CNN. ""They're the ones that need to be more careful.
Antonov after the meeting said the drone ""deliberately and provocatively was moving toward Russian territory with transponders turned off.""
He said his meeting at the State Department was constructive and the issue of possible consequences for Moscow over the incident was not raised, RIA state news agency reported.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,Analysis: Fear of the dark: Taiwan sees wartime frailty in communication links with world,Sarah Wu,2023-03-16 00:04:00+00:00,,"TAIPEI, March 15 (Reuters) - Taiwan is scrambling to secure its communications with the outside world against an attack by China, but even in peacetime cannot quickly repair critical undersea internet cables and lacks suitable satellite backups, experts and officials say.
China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has ramped up military and political efforts to force the democratically governed island to accept its sovereignty.
The Ukraine war has lent new urgency to Taiwan's efforts to bolster its security, especially against Chinese cyber attacks or attempts to sever any of 14 cables that connect it to the global internet.
""Strategic communications, internally and externally, is what keeps us up at night, particularly in the aftermath of Ukraine,"" said Tzeng Yisuo, an analyst at Taiwan's top military think tank, the Institute for National Defence and Security Research.
View 2 more stories 
Taiwan has zeroed in on low-Earth orbit satellites as a solution, and has launched a two-year trial programme to boost internet services by leaning on international satellite providers.
Taiwan's total satellite bandwidth is about 0.02% of what its undersea cables provide, according to Kenny Huang, chief executive at Taiwan Network Information Center, the island's internet domain manager.
Huang said Taiwan has struggled to attract interest from international satellite companies because of strict regulations on ownership, which limit foreign shares to a maximum of 49%, and a lack of financial sweeteners.
""There's little incentive for them (foreign companies),"" he said. ""Regulations must be changed.""
Defence experts say that although Taiwan can draw lessons from Ukraine's use of Starlink, a satellite network developed by Elon Musk's U.S.-based space exploration company SpaceX, they worry about relying on a commercial actor with business interests in China.
""Elon Musk, we are not certain if he cares more about China's market,"" Tzeng said, referring to Tesla's sales in China. ""We won't put all our eggs in one basket.""
Taiwan does not own any Starlink terminals. SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan is also strengthening the resilience of wartime communication channels for top commanders, including the president, according to one senior government official and another person familiar with government efforts.
""We are taking notes from Zelenskiy,"" a senior Taiwan security official said, referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's strong presence on social media.
Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs said in a statement that it would prioritise Taiwan's offshore islands for the satellite trial programme and would further increase the bandwidth for microwave communications with outlying islands by year-end. The ministry did not comment on sea cables or repairing them.
Taiwan's vulnerability was thrown into focus last month when the two undersea cables connecting the Taiwan-controlled Matsu islands, which sit close to the Chinese coast, were cut, disconnecting the 14,000 people who live there from the internet.
Authorities said that their initial findings show a Chinese fishing vessel and a Chinese freighter caused the disruption, but that there was no evidence Beijing deliberately tampered with the cables. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chunghwa Telecom switched on a backup microwave system that transmits signals from the top of a mountain in Taipei to Matsu, but that only restored about 5% of the bandwidth that the cables had provided.
This month, the government upgraded the system and internet speed significantly improved. But because there are few cable repair ships in the region, residents must wait until late April for internet access to be fully restored.
A senior Taiwan official familiar with security matters said that sea cable vulnerability has long been a national security concern, and that it was ""ridiculous"" so little progress had been made to address the issue. The person declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""We can't even fix sea cables on our own,"" the official said.
Lii Wen, who leads the Matsu branch of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, described the February outage as a ""warning"" to Taiwan.
""Today, it's Matsu's sea cables that broke,"" he said. ""What if one day all 14 of Taiwan's undersea cables connecting us to the outside world break? Will we be adequately prepared?""
China will probably take aim at Taiwan's sea cables or the cable landing stations before an all-out attack, experts say, a move that would cause panic, paralyse commercial activity, and help Beijing gain control over the international narrative.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan's military has long prepared back-up plans, including a fibre-optic network for communications within Taiwan, satellites, high-frequency radio, and microwave systems.
The impact on civilians would be severe regardless, and authorities are reinforcing Taiwan's four entry points for international sea cables and running more frequent war simulations involving them, Huang said.
""In a state of emergency, people will want to get information,"" said Chieh Chung, a military researcher at the National Policy Foundation, a Taipei-based think tank. ""If they can't get information, people's panic will spread.""
Cutting off communications and causing chaos would not be the only military effects of severing the cables, Huang said. Taiwan might find it difficult to calibrate a response to such a move that an aggressor couldn't use to justify an all-out attack.
""So the first step (for China) - with about 99 percent likelihood - is to cut our sea cables,"" Huang said.

World,/world/us-says-russian-jet-caused-spy-drone-crash-over-black-sea-moscow-denies-2023-03-14/,"Video shows Russia jet intercept US drone, Ukraine forces hold on in Bakhmut",Mike Collett-White,2023-03-16 14:19:00+00:00,,"NEAR BAKHMUT, Ukraine/WASHINGTON, March 16 (Reuters) - The Pentagon released on Thursday a de-classified video showing a Russian military jet intercept a U.S. drone downed over the Black Sea two days ago, rare footage that highlights the risks of a direct clash between the world's leading nuclear powers.
The United States has said Tuesday's incident shows Russia is behaving irresponsibly in international airspace, while Moscow accuses Washington of trying to escalate tensions near Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula it forcibly annexed in 2014.
Meanwhile, on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv's forces continued to withstand Russian assaults on the now-ruined city of Bakhmut. Reuters reporters heard a constant rumble of artillery on all sides at about 1.5 km (0.9 mile) from the frontline.
""Sometimes we see groups of seven people (Russian soldiers). We strike, three fall and the rest continue to advance,"" said Marian, 21, a member of Ukraine's 80th Air Assault Brigade, at a mortar position, describing his experiences along the front.
View 2 more stories 
The brigade fired seven mortars from that position, while small arms fire could also be heard in the distance.
The release of the Pentagon video came a day after U.S. and Russian defence ministers and military chiefs held phone conversations over the incident that saw the MQ-9 Reaper drone crash into the sea while on a reconnaissance mission in international airspace.
In the roughly 40-second video, a Russian Su-27 fighter jet comes very close to the U.S. drone and dumps what U.S. officials say was jet fuel near it in an apparent effort to damage the American aircraft as it flew over the Black Sea.
It also shows the loss of the video feed after a second pass by a Russian jet, which the Pentagon says resulted from its collision with the drone. The video ends with images of the drone's damaged propeller, which the Pentagon says resulted from the collision, making the aircraft inoperable.
Russia has denied any collision and said the drone crashed after making ""sharp manoeuvres"", having ""provocatively"" flown close to Russian air space near Crimea.
General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Wednesday it was clear that the intercept and harassment of the drone by Russian jets was intentional, but it was unclear whether the Russian pilots meant to slam their aircraft into the drone - a move that could also put them at risk.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin that U.S. drone flights near Crimea's coast ""were provocative in nature"" and could lead to ""an escalation... in the Black Sea zone,"" a ministry statement said.
Russia, the statement said, has ""no interest"" in escalation ""but will in future react in due proportion"" and the two countries should ""act with a maximum of responsibility"", including by having military lines of communication in a crisis.

Russia has said the episode showed Washington was directly participating in the Ukraine war, something the West has taken pains to avoid.
The United States has supported Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in military aid but says its troops have not become directly engaged in the war, which Moscow portrays as a conflict against the combined might of the West.
Poland said on Thursday it would send four MiG-29 fighter jets to neighbouring Ukraine in coming days, making it the first of Kyiv's allies to provide such aircraft.
In eastern Ukraine, the Russian-installed leader of the Donetsk region said on Thursday the situation around Bakhmut remained ""complex and difficult"" as Kyiv refused to withdraw its forces.
""That is, we do not see that there is any premise that the enemy is going to simply withdraw units,"" Denis Pushilin said in an interview on state TV.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this week his military top brass had advised reinforcing Bakhmut.
Kyiv had appeared last month to be preparing to pull out of the city but has since decided to defend it, saying it is exhausting Russia's attacking force there to pave the way for its own counter-attack.
In its daily intelligence update on the Ukraine war, Britain's defence ministry said Russian attempts to capture the town of Vuhledar, about 150 km (93 miles) southwest of Bakhmut, had ""almost certainly slowed"" after repeated, very costly failed attacks over the last three months.
Russia has committed wide-ranging war crimes in Ukraine such as wilful killings, torture and the deportation of children, a U.N.-mandated investigative body said in a report published on Thursday. Moscow denies committing atrocities in Ukraine.
The report, based on more than 500 interviews as well as satellite images and visits to detention sites and graves, comes as the International Criminal Court in The Hague is expected to seek the arrest of Russian officials for forcibly deporting children from Ukraine and targeting civilian infrastructure.
The war has resulted in the destruction of Ukrainian towns and cities, the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the flight of millions from their homes. It has also rocked the global economy, pushing up energy and food prices.
President Vladimir Putin, meeting members of Russia's business elite on Thursday for the first time since the invasion, urged them to invest in their country to help it weather what he called the West's ""sanctions war"".
Many of those attending the meeting are themselves under Western sanctions because of what Putin calls Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,"Learning from Ukraine, Taiwan shows off its drones as key to 'asymmetric warfare'",Yimou Lee,2023-03-14 16:03:00+00:00,,"TAICHUNG, Taiwan, March 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan showcased new models of its domestically produced military drones on Tuesday, saying they are key to its ""asymmetric warfare"" capacity to make its forces more agile if they have to face a far larger Chinese military.
China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has ramped up military activity near the democratically governed island to force it to accept Chinese sovereignty despite Taiwan's objections.
The war in Ukraine has lent new urgency to Taiwan military's efforts to bolster defence including a push to develop drones.
In a rare display of its drone capabilities, the military-owned National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), showed off its latest models, including the Albatross II surveillance drone, and combat drones that operate with global positioning system satellites.

NCSIST head Art Chang said the war in Ukraine had focused attention on drones, and his institution had teamed up with Taiwan companies to build a ""national team"" to develop military drones.
Taiwan's military has announced a partnership with companies aimed at producing 3,000 drones next year.
Chi Li-Pin, director of Aeronautical Systems Research Division for NCSIST, said the armed forces should increase their adoption of drones in their strategies.

""I hope our national troops can familiarise themselves with this weapon of asymmetric warfare and use them boldly,"" he told reporters at an NCSIST facility in the central city of Taichung.
President Tsai Ing-wen has championed the idea of ""asymmetric warfare"" to make Taiwan's forces more mobile and harder to attack.
Taiwan's armed forces are well-equipped but still dwarfed by China's.
Among the drones on display was an attack drone with loitering munitions that can cruise towards a target before plummeting at velocity and detonating on impact.
China has sent its drones to areas close to Taiwan to test its responses, the island's defence ministry has said.
Last year, Taiwan shot down a civilian drone that entered its airspace near an islet off the Chinese coast.
The island's defence ministry said in a report to parliament this week, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, that China was quickly building up its combat capacity with drones, including swarms of flying robots.
In response, Taiwan will focus on developing its combat and surveillance drones, as well as anti-drone systems, the ministry said.

World,/world/europe/,"Greeks protest over deadly train crash, station master jailed pending trial",Alkis Konstantinidis,2023-03-06 08:30:00+00:00,,"ATHENS, March 5 (Reuters) - A Greek railway employee was jailed on Sunday pending trial over a deadly train crash that killed at least 57 people, as Greeks seethed with anger over the worst rail disaster in living memory.
Protests continued to reverberate days after a head-on collision of a passenger train and a freight carrier on the Athens-Thessaloniki route late in the evening of Feb. 28.
Clashes erupted between police and demonstrators in Athens on Sunday, after thousands rallied to protest over the crash.
The 59-year-old Larissa station master faces multiple charges of disrupting transport and putting lives at risk.
The man, who cannot be named under Greek law, was questioned for seven hours before a magistrate on Sunday before being detained.
""For about 20 cursed minutes he was responsible for the safety of the whole of central Greece,"" his lawyer Stefanos Pantzartzidis said.
On Thursday, Pantzartzidis said that his client was devastated and had assumed responsibility ""proportionate to him"" but other factors were also at play, without elaborating.

Railway workers say the country's rail network has been creaking under cost-cutting and underinvestment, a legacy of Greece's debilitating debt crisis from 2010 to 2018.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, who blamed the crash on human error, acknowledged that decades of neglect could have contributed to the disaster.
""As prime minister, I owe everyone, but most of all the relatives of the victims, an apology,"" he wrote on his Facebook account. ""Justice will very fast investigate the tragedy and determine liabilities.""
After protests over the past three days across the country, some 10,000 people gathered in an Athens square on Sunday to express sympathy for the lives lost and to demand better safety standards on the rail network.
""That crime won't be forgotten,"" protesters shouted as they released black balloons into the sky. A placard read: ""Their policies cost human lives.""
Railway workers' unions say safety systems throughout the rail network have been deficient for years as a remote surveillance and signalling system has not been delivered on time. They have called on the government to provide a timetable for the implementation of safety protocols.
Mitsotakis said on Sunday that if there had been a remote system in place throughout the rail network ""it would have been, in practice, impossible for the accident to happen"".

World,/world/us/,US senators blast Treasury's 'lack of progress' on climate risks,Andrea Shalal,2023-03-10 17:57:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WKHB3ISD2NNBZMPMY44Y2RMQO4.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Three U.S. senators blasted the Treasury Department on Thursday for what they called its failure to act more swiftly on countering climate risks, and they urged Secretary Janet Yellen to appoint a new climate counselor to lead the effort.
In a letter to Yellen viewed by Reuters, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse and Edward Markey criticized the work done by John Morton, Yellen's first climate counselor. Morton stepped down in December and returned to the private sector.
The senators said nearly two years had passed since Treasury created a ""Climate Hub"" and named Morton to coordinate its strategies, but the results have been disappointing.
Yellen has not yet named a replacement for Morton, although Treasury has dozens of people working on climate-related issues, including some in key senior positions.
Treasury spokesperson Julia Krieger underscored the key role the department and the Climate Hub had played on climate issues, including through passage of the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy tax incentives, its work to better understand climate-related financial risks and international efforts.
View 2 more stories 
""Treasury has been central to delivering on the Biden Administration’s climate agenda,"" she said, when asked about the senators' letter. ""The Climate Hub has played a critical role coordinating this overall agenda and providing expertise to support climate-related policy development and implementation.""
A second Treasury official said the criticism of Morton was frustrating, given his leadership on key initiatives, including $279 billion in clean energy tax credits under the IRA and in mobilizing capital for climate-friendly energy transitions around the world.
In their letter, the senators also faulted Treasury's leadership of climate work by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which identified climate change as an ""emerging and increasing threat to U.S. financial stability"" in October 2021.
The second Treasury official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the independent agencies grouped under FSOC were taking action, but those steps followed prescribed processes. No Treasury climate counselor could speed up that work since the agencies were independent, the official said.
The senators also said Treasury had failed to use its power as the largest shareholder in the International Monetary Fund to halt lending that enabled fossil fuel expansion in other countries, noting that other countries were moving faster.
They asked Yellen to respond to over a dozen questions on Treasury's efforts to mitigate risks to the U.S. economy posed by accelerating climate change and a timeline for doing so.
Yellen this week told an advisory panel climate change was already having a major economic and financial impact on the United States and may trigger asset value losses in coming years that could cascade through the U.S. financial system.

World,/world/us/,"US releases a third of electronics detained under China forced labor law, data shows",Nichola Groom,2023-03-14 19:21:00+00:00,,"March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. customs officials have released more than a third of the electronic equipment, including solar panels, detained since last year under a new law meant to weed out products made with forced labor, according to data released on Tuesday.
The release of the new data dashboard by U.S. Customs and Border Protection comes a week after Reuters reported that U.S. imports of solar panels are finally picking up after months of gridlock stemming from implementation of the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act.
The stalled imports from major Chinese panel suppliers including Trina Solar Co Ltd (688599.SS) and Jinko Solar Holding Co Ltd (JKS.N) caused major delays in U.S. solar project development at a time when the sector is booming - a setback to the Biden administration's climate goals.
According to the data, CBP has released 552 electronics shipments worth $345 million out of a total of 1,627 industry shipments valued at $841 million that were held for examination.
View 2 more stories 
While it was unknown what percentage of those shipments are solar equipment, Reuters reported last year that as of late October, CBP had detained more than 1,000 shipments of solar energy equipment.
The UFLPA prohibits imports of products made in China's Xinjiang region, where Chinese authorities are reported to have established labor camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups. China denies any abuses.
The law requires producers to show sourcing documentation of imported equipment back to the raw material to prove that no portion came from Xinjiang.
The electronics sector accounts for 88% of the $961 million in total shipments that have been detained under the UFLPLA since June of last year. Just 17 electronics shipments, worth $7 million, have been denied entry into the U.S. market.
Most of the electronic shipments that were subjected to reviews were imported from Malaysia and Vietnam, with far smaller amounts from Thailand and China, according to CBP.
The data also shows detainments peaked in the federal government's fiscal fourth quarter that ended in September and have steadily declined since then.

World,/world/us/,US EPA finalizes rule to tackle interstate smog,Valerie Volcovici,2023-03-15 17:12:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OAYSMW6Q3ZKTNJBO7CJ2CMWFDU.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday finalized a rule to require industrial facilities and power plants in 23 states to cut their smog-forming nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, one of several air quality and climate regulations it is due to unveil.
The EPA's final ""Good Neighbor"" plan is expected to ensure that 23 states curb NOx emissions from facilities that pollute across state lines and meet obligations for the 2015 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
Ground-level ozone, or smog, can cause respiratory and heart issues and can travel downwind across state lines, affecting over 127 million people. States ranging from New York to Texas to Nevada would be subject to the rule.
""EPA's 'Good Neighbor' plan will lock in significant pollution reductions to ensure cleaner air and deliver public health protections for those who've suffered far too long from air-quality related impacts and illness,"" said EPA Administrator Michael Regan.
View 2 more stories 
The rule is one of several measures aimed at cleaning up power and industrial sector emissions that the agency is expected to roll out this spring. Other rules, including new greenhouse gas standards for power plants, are expected as soon as April.
Starting in 2023, affected power plants will participate in a revised ozone season trading program. The EPA would tighten emissions limits over time to encourage a phased installation of pollution controls from 2024.
The EPA will also require consistent operation of emissions controls to protect downwind regions and set a maximum daily emission rate for plants.
Beginning in the 2026 ozone season, EPA will set enforceable NOx emissions control requirements for existing and new emissions sources ranging from cement kilns to solid waste incinerators.
""We are pleased that EPA has responded to calls from overburdened communities to require pollution reductions from industrial sources in addition to power plants and to ensure the largest coal-fired power plants run their pollution controls every day of the ozone season,"" said Kathleen Riley, a lawyer for Earthjustice.
EPA estimates the final rule will reduce NOx emissions by 70,000 tonnes during the 2026 ozone season compared to a business-as-usual scenario. It would also result in an annual reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 16 million tonnes.

World,/world/africa/,Factbox: Why is Cyclone Freddy a record-breaking storm?,Nellie Peyton,2023-03-15 12:40:00+00:00,,"JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Reuters) - Tropical cyclone Freddy hit the coast of southern Africa for a second time over the weekend, bringing its total death toll to more than 220 people in Malawi, Mozambique and Madagascar.
The month-long storm has broken at least one record and could break two more, meteorologists say.
As climate change causes warmer oceans, heat energy from the water's surface is fuelling stronger storms.
Below are some of the main reasons Freddy is noteworthy.
Freddy holds the record for most accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), a measure based on a storm's wind strength over its lifetime, of any storm in the southern hemisphere and possibly worldwide.
Freddy has generated about as much accumulated cyclone energy as an average full North Atlantic hurricane season, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
By last week it was in second place for the most accumulated cyclone energy of any storm since 1980, with the record held by Hurricane and Typhoon Ioke in 2006.
View 2 more stories 
Some estimates show that Freddy has since broken that record, with 86 ACE compared to Ioke's 85 ACE.
Freddy may have broken the record for longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization.

The current record is held by a 31-day hurricane in 1994.
Freddy first developed on Feb. 6 and made its second landfall on the coast of Mozambique on March 11, 34 days later.
However, experts still have to look at several factors, such as the fact that it weakened below tropical cyclone status at some points during that time, in order to determine whether it broke the record, the World Meteorological Organization said.
Freddy appears to have broken the world record for the most bouts of rapid intensification, defined as an increase in wind speed of 35 miles per hour in a period of 24 hours.
Freddy had seven separate cycles of rapid intensification, according to satellite estimates, said the World Meteorological Organization. The previous record was four, which was reached by several hurricanes.
The World Meteorological Organization will set up an expert committee to examine this record, as well as the others, it said.
Freddy developed off the coast of Australia, crossed the entire South Indian Ocean and travelled more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles) to make landfall in Madagascar and Mozambique in late February.
It then looped back and hit the coast of Mozambique again two weeks later, before moving inland to Malawi.
""No other tropical cyclones observed in this part of the world have taken such a path across the Indian Ocean in the past two decades,"" said the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in an article.
Only four storms have crossed the southern Indian Ocean from east to west, with the last one in 2000, it said.

World,/world/us/,"Louisiana's request to oversee carbon storage projects moving ahead, EPA says",Liz Hampton,2023-03-15 22:17:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/TVOS3EEIZ5LH7B4ZIXVOELRZVI.jpg,"March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by May should complete a review of Louisiana's request to take on oversight of carbon capture projects, according to a letter to the state, which wants to speed up approvals.
Louisiana is seeking to permit and monitor so-called Class VI wells, which bury carbon dioxide and other climate-warming gases underground. EPA now decides most requests and permitting has taken years in some cases, critics say.
The state is responsible for about 16% of oil output and ranks third in natural gas and reserves, according to the Energy Information Administration. It is home to the most number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, which plan to bury emissions as a way to mitigate their climate impact.
After the EPA reviews Louisiana's application, there will be a 60-day public comment period, EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in the letter to Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards dated March 13.

Edwards this year wrote to the EPA's administrator to request an update on the application process, citing concerns about a lack of communication by the federal agency.
Carbon capture recently got a shot in the arm through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which provides incentives for carbon projects to make them economically attractive.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N), Talos Energy (TALO.N) and Verde CO2 are firms eying carbon capture and storage projects in Louisiana.
Louisiana's application was revised by the state's Natural Resources Department and regional EPA office to ensure protections for low-income and minority residents, resulting in a memorandum of agreement (MOA), the letter said.
The MOA protections will help build ""a robust environmental justice program ... and will serve as an example for future MOAs between the EPA and other states seeking Class VI primacy,"" Regan wrote.

World,/world/china/,China to raise retirement age to deal with aging population - media,Reuters,2023-03-14 15:11:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FCHVOFYLBRJWJM46D2SP5FBBB4.jpg,"HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - China is planning to raise its retirement age gradually and in phases to cope with the country's rapidly aging population, the state-backed Global Times said on Tuesday, citing a senior expert from China's Ministry of Human Resources.
Jin Weigang, president of the Chinese Academy of Labor and Social Security Sciences, said China was eyeing a ""progressive, flexible and differentiated path to raising the retirement age"", meaning that it would be delayed initially by a few months, which would be subsequently increased.
""People nearing retirement age will only have to delay retirement for several months,"" the Global Times said, citing Jin. Young people may have to work a few years longer but will have a long adaptation and transition period, he said.
""The most important feature of the reform is allowing people to choose when to retire according to their circumstances and conditions.""
China has yet to formally announce a change to its retirement age, which is among the lowest in the world at 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women and 50 for women who work in factories.

Li Qiang, the country's new premier, said on Monday that the government would conduct rigorous studies and analyses to roll out a policy prudently in discourse.
As China's 1.4 billion population declines and ages, in part because of a policy that limited couples to one child from 1980 to 2015, pressure on pension budgets is escalating, creating more urgency for policymakers to address the situation.
China's National Health Commission expects the cohort of people aged 60 and over to rise from 280 million to more than 400 million by 2035 - equal to the entire current populations of Britain and the United States combined.
Life expectancy has risen from around 44 years in 1960 to 78 years as of 2021, higher than in the United States, and is projected to exceed 80 years by 2050.
At present, each retiree is supported by the contributions of five workers. The ratio is half what it was a decade ago and is trending towards 4-to-1 in 2030 and 2-to-1 in 2050.
Demographers and economists say that the current pension system, which relies on a shrinking active workforce to pay the pensions of a growing number of retirees, is unsustainable and needs to be reformed.
Eleven of China's 31 provincial-level jurisdictions are running pension budget deficits, finance ministry data show. The state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences sees the pension system running out of money by 2035.

World,/world/europe/,Russia's Navalny dedicates his part in Oscar movie to those fighting dictatorship,Reuters,2023-03-15 17:10:00+00:00,,"March 15 (Reuters) - Jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Wednesday dedicated his part in an Oscar-winning film about him to those fighting against dictatorship and war.
Director Daniel Roher's film ""Navalny"", about the poisoning that nearly killed Russia's most prominent opposition figure and his detention upon returning to Moscow in 2021, won the Oscar for best feature documentary on Sunday.
In a series of tweets released by his supporters, Navalny said the early morning radio news bulletin in the penal colony where he is serving an 11-1/2-year sentence had omitted the documentary category from its report on the Oscar ceremony.
""A good sign,"" Navalny said he had thought to himself.
But he only received confirmation that the film had won when he attended a court session by video-link and his lawyer gave him the news.
""Of course I'm terribly happy and, as I rejoice, I try not to forget that it wasn't me who got the Oscar,"" he said, praising Roher, his own close aide Maria Pevchikh, and Bulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev - ""the true star of this film"".
View 2 more stories 
He thanked his wife Yulia for supporting him ""and a couple of times stopping me from killing the film crew"".
Navalny finished by saying: ""I dedicate all my contribution to honest and courageous people, wherever they live, who find the strength day after day to resist the monster of dictatorship and its constant companion - war.""
In the film, Navalny and Grozev pinned responsibility for the poisoning episode on a team of agents from the FSB state security service.
Russia has denied attempting to kill him. On Monday the Kremlin said that the award showed ""a certain element of politicisation"" in Hollywood.
After returning from Germany, where he recovered from the poisoning, Navalny was immediately detained. He is now serving time on charges of fraud and contempt of court that he says were trumped up to silence him.

World,/world/europe/,Russia's Oscar-winning opposition is mired in conflict,Mark Trevelyan,2023-03-15 16:21:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Kremlin critics were cheered this week when a Western documentary about jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny won an Oscar, but his political movement is in turmoil and some Ukrainian politicians say the award is undeserved.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most high-profile domestic critic, is serving 11-1/2 years in jail in Russia after being convicted of fraud in two cases he and the West say were trumped up to silence him, and his anti-corruption organisation has been banned as extremist.
His supporters cast him as a Russian version of Nelson Mandela who survived an assassination attempt and will one day be freed from unjust imprisonment to lead Russia. The lawyer-turned-activist remains a fierce Kremlin critic, releasing regular statements via his lawyers from behind bars.
But his Anti-Corruption Foundation (ACF), which now operates outside Russia, is reeling after his Chief of Staff Leonid Volkov admitted he had - without his colleagues' knowledge - lobbied the European Union to lift sanctions on Mikhail Fridman, one of Russia's richest men.
View 2 more stories 
Volkov apologised for what he said was ""a big political mistake"" and said he was taking a break from his role as chairman of the ACF.
Yet some fellow opposition members were furious, saying the ACF should be trying to hasten Putin's political demise rather than helping wealthy businessmen.
Vladimir Milov, a Navalny ally and a former deputy energy minister, said some in the opposition had shown themselves to be ""super-naive"" in seeking the lifting of sanctions on Fridman, whom he described as Russia's ""champion corporate raider"".
""It inflicts colossal damage on the image of the Russian opposition,"" said Milov. ""After this it will be necessary to restore the reputation of the Russian opposition in the West.""
The lobbying effort was made public in apparent revenge by Alexei Venediktov, a prominent journalist who for years gave the opposition a platform on the Moscow radio station he ran while maintaining ties with the authorities.
Navalny's team had accused Venediktov of taking millions of dollars from the Moscow city budget, which is controlled by a Putin ally, to publish magazines. Venediktov admitted winning a publishing contract, but denied wrongdoing or making a profit. Both he and Volkov were designated ""foreign agents"" by Moscow in April 2022.
Leonid Nevzlin, a tycoon and prominent Israel-based Kremlin critic, said on Twitter that the opposition needed to unite.
""While Ukraine is fighting for its freedom, the Russian oppositionists have decided to open a second front... Unfortunately, not to fight Putin, but to fight among themselves,"" he lamented.
Ksenia Thorstrom, an opposition politician from St Petersburg who has now left Russia, said she too craved unity. ""But unfortunately exactly the opposite is happening at the moment,"" she said in a phone interview.
The Oscar award also focused attention on Navalny's stance on Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. That year, he said he did not think Crimea was a sandwich that could be passed back and forth.
Navalny had long said he would hold an honest referendum asking Crimea's residents which country they wanted to be part of if he became president. Last month, however, he changed tack and said Russia must respect Ukraine's 1991 borders.
Some Ukrainians were unconvinced, and shocked that the documentary about him won the Oscar rather than a Ukrainian contender, a co-production called ""House of Splinters"" - which tells the story of an orphanage destroyed by Russian forces.
""Tonight proved once again that Russian propaganda works very well and knows how to promote pseudo-heroes where there are no heroes,"" Azad Safarov, who helped make the Ukrainian co-production, said on Facebook.
Andriy Sadovyi, the Mayor of the Ukrainian city of Lviv, recalled Navalny's Crimea sandwich comments with distaste.
""Navalny is a sandwich packed in a lunch box carried around the world as an example of the fact that there is still opposition in Russia,"" Sadovyi wrote on Twitter, adding that it smelled of Russian propaganda and now of the Oscar statuette.
Maria Snegovaya, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the opposition in exile's messaging on the Ukraine war was hobbled by fear of alienating supporters in Russia, where anti-war feeling is not widespread.
""It's been a year, and yet the Russian opposition in exile remains even more disunited and the infighting continues,"" she said in a phone interview.
Navalny alluded obliquely to the conflict in a tweeted response to the Oscar on Wednesday, hailing those around the world who ""find the strength to confront the monster of dictatorship and its constant companion, war"".
Nikita Yuferev, a Russian opposition municipal deputy now living abroad, acknowledged disarray within the opposition but blamed a 20-year Kremlin crackdown. ""It's headless, it's disoriented, but there are objective reasons for that.""
Navalny ally Milov said it would persevere.
""Problems and mistakes happen but we managed to survive the terrible blow that Putin has been inflicting on us these last few years,"" Milov said on YouTube.
""We're not about to give up.""

World,/world/uk/,Britain helps pubs by raising 'draught relief' on beer,Reuters,2023-03-15 16:12:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/KBGGN223CZMBRDFMYVOZAB7V7Q.jpg,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Britain's finance minister Jeremy Hunt offered some help to pubs on Wednesday by increasing ""draught relief"", making the rate of duty on draught beer and cider up to 11 pence lower than the charge on cans or bottles bought in a supermarket from August.
The measure will coincide with a rise in alcohol taxes in line with inflation, ending a freeze that has been in since 2020, and will result in no change in the duty paid on a typical pint poured from a tap in a pub, the government said.
""In December, I extended the alcohol duty freeze until August 1st, after which duties will go up in line with inflation in the usual way,"" Hunt told parliament in his budget statement.
""But today, I will do something that was not possible when we were in the EU and significantly increase the generosity of Draught Relief, so that from August 1st the duty on draught products in pubs will be up to 11p lower than the duty in supermarkets, a differential we will maintain as part of a new Brexit pubs guarantee.""

The government is also pressing ahead with reforms that will increase taxes on stronger alcoholic products, such as wines and spirits.
JD Wetherspoon's (JDW.L) chairman Tim Martin said any reduction in the tax disparity between pubs and supermarkets was welcome.
""This gesture by the government is a tacit acknowledgment that something needs to be done,"" he said.
Diageo (DGE.L), the maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky, said the alcohol duty rises would be a ""hammer blow for pubs, drinkers and for Scotch, a homegrown industry supporting tens of thousands of jobs"".
""We urge the chancellor to reverse this punitive and inflationary tax hike,"" said Diageo GB Managing Director Nuno Teles.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,"Indonesia court jails policeman over deadly soccer stampede, 2 acquitted",Reuters,2023-03-16 13:00:00+00:00,,"SURABAYA, Indonesia, March 16 (Reuters) - An Indonesian court on Thursday jailed a policeman but cleared two other officers of negligence over crowd control measures deployed at a local soccer match that led to one of the world's deadliest stadium stampedes.
The October 2022 derby in Malang, East Java, between Arema FC and Persebaya Surabaya ended in chaos with 135 spectators killed, many crushed as they fled for exits after police fired tear gas into the crowd.
Last week, two Arema match officials were also jailed for negligence, in the first verdicts over the stampede.
One of the policemen, Hasdarmawan, was on Thursday sentenced to one and a half years in prison, for what Judge Abu Achmad Shiddqi Hamsya said was ""negligence in causing people to die or sustain severe injuries.""
Authorities had earlier said Hasdarmawan had ordered police to fire tear gas, which soccer's world governing body FIFA has banned as a crowd control measure.
View 2 more stories 
An investigation by Indonesia's human rights commission found the stadium was over capacity and the main cause of the stampede was police firing into the crowd 45 rounds of tear gas.
Two other officers, Bambang Sidik Achmadi and Wahyu Setyo Pranoto were cleared of wrongdoing and released on Thursday. Police had earlier said Bambang had given an order to use tear gas and Wahyu had not acted to stop it. Both had pleaded not guilty.
One of the considerations of the judge acquitting Bambang was that smoke from the tear gas was blown by the wind towards the pitch.
""It had never reached the stand,"" said the judge.
Amnesty International Indonesia said authorities had again failed to provide justice.
""It sends a dangerous message to members of the security forces who may be reassured they can operate with a free hand and zero consequences,"" said its director Usman Hamid.
Isa Atu Sa'adah, sister of one of the victims said the verdicts were too lenient and all those responsible should be punished evenly.
""The verdict has torn our sense of justice and humanity,"" Isa said at the court.
The lawyer for the three defendants said no decision had been made on whether Hasdarmawan would appeal, while East Java's prosecutor's office said it was still reviewing the verdict before deciding on an appeal.
Indonesian soccer has been fraught with scandals and crowd trouble, with some key fixtures played behind closed doors due to security concerns. Indonesia is preparing to host the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in May.

Oil and gas producers had called for floor prices to be applied to a windfall tax imposed last year and renewable power companies wanted better investment incentives, but finance minister Jeremy Hunt's spring budget included no such actions.
""In addition to the measures in the spring budget, the government will set out further action later this month to ensure energy security in the UK and meet our net zero commitments,"" the government said in a budget document.
Both the oil and gas and renewables industries will watch for any updates to how the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) tax applied to the former and the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) applied to the latter might change.

""In the face of this draconian cash grab – which simply makes new investment unviable - there is a real possibility that the entire UK onshore wind and solar industry shuts up shop and is forced to move to Europe or United States.""
Wednesday's budget included some incentives for nuclear power and carbon capture and storage projects.
""While we welcome the support for decarbonisation and carbon capture and storage, the UK risks becoming a hostile environment for wider investment in domestic offshore energy,"" said David Whitehouse, head of the OEUK oil and gas industry association.

The plan by Britain's Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and Borders to Coast, which together oversee 130 billion pounds ($156.36 billion) in assets, was part of efforts to push oil companies and banks to make faster progress on climate change pledges, the report added.
""Our new stewardship and voting policy will see us vote more personally against responsible directors where possible,"" USS said in a statement to Reuters.
As a long term investor, ""we'll do this where a company hasn't disclosed its climate transition plan, doesn't meet our diversity expectations, or where executive pay doesn't align with company performance,"" it added.

In February, BP said it aimed to cut emissions from fuels sold to customers by 20% to 30% by 2030, less than an earlier target of a 35% to 40% reduction, and it planned to reduce its total emissions to net zero by 2050.
Shell has pledged to be a net zero carbon company by 2050 and has said its overall carbon emissions peaked in 2018 at around 1.7 billion tonnes.

The 10-year old company for the second half of 2022 reported adjusted core earnings of 6.6 million pounds, rebounding from a 84.6 million pound loss a year earlier and a 51.6 million pound loss in the first half.
CEO Will Shu said Deliveroo had made ""a lot of progress on its path to profitability"" despite a challenging consumer environment, noting it had reached core earnings breakeven in the second half.
""This is obviously one of the milestones to becoming more profitable, but I think we're really proud of this because we reached it 12 to 18 months before we said we would, and then in '23 we expect to make continued progress,"" he said in an interview on Thursday.

Shu said the improvement was driven by optimising consumer fees, lower marketing spend and new revenue from advertising on its platform.
Deliveroo said in January that the number of orders dropped by 2% in the final quarter, although inflation had helped the total value increase 6% to 1.8 billion pounds.
Shu said it was ""not the easiest time"" for consumers, although sentiment ""had improved slightly in the few weeks"".
But the outlook remained volatile, he added.
Deliveroo said the first quarter of 2023 was expected to be broadly flat before improving, with gross transaction value for 2023 expected to grow by low to mid single digits.
Adjusted core earnings were expected to be in 20-50 million pounds, it said.

""We need strong legislation and hopefully we can put something together that's bipartisan,"" Schumer told reporters following a closed policy lunch with his fellow Democrats.
Schumer's comments came in response to a question about whether he would support legislation spearheaded by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, which would reinstate banking regulations and oversight rolled back under former President Donald Trump.
He declined to say whether he would support Warren's bill.
Calls for increased oversight of the U.S. banking industry grew as fallout from Friday's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) widened.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, however, downplayed the likelihood of Congress passing a ""significant"" banking bill anytime soon. ""There are people who will introduce bills, but I cannot imagine -- with the hold that the banks have on Republicans in Congress -- that we could pass anything significant,"" Brown, a Democrat, told reporters.
Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives and Democrats do not control enough votes in the Senate to advance legislation without Republican cooperation.
Brown said his committee would hold oversight hearings. ""We'll bring in the regulators, for sure,"" he said.
Senators are largely unified on demanding answers from regulators about the SVB collapse.
""Most of our members want to have the question answered by the regulators, what happened? How come they were asleep at the switch and didn't see this coming?"" Senator John Thune, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, told reporters.
He disagreed with Schumer on whether more legislation was necessary.
""I think it would be premature to start talking about solutions before we fully define the problem,"" he said.
Compounding fears of contagion from SVB's collapse is Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), one of 30 global financial institutions considered systematically important by the international Financial Stability Board.
On Wednesday stock prices of the Swiss bank plunged after its largest shareholder, the Saudi National Bank (1180.SE), said it could not provide further financial support.
The news re-ignited jitters among investors about the resilience of the global banking system.
""Everybody is concerned"" about the impact of Credit Suisse on the U.S. bank system, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on Wednesday.
""I don't see this being widespread but it's very, very important to stay on top of it and the administration is,"" Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow, a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, told Reuters. ""Nobody takes this lightly and they're monitoring all of this very closely.""

World,/world/americas/,Analysis: Mexico data hack exposes government cybersecurity vulnerability,Diego Oré,2022-10-01 00:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2KZS5VF44ZPU5NBAPHLI3G5CWI.jpg,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 30 - A major hack into classified government information in Mexico, including thousands of emails from the armed forces, exposed the country's vulnerability to cyberattacks due to under-investment and poor technological preparedness, experts said on Friday.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador confirmed on Friday the Defense Ministry had suffered a hack that revealed details about his heart condition - a form of angina - as well as information on criminal figures, transcripts of communications, and the monitoring of the U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
A group called ""Guacamaya"" - or ""macaw"" in Spanish - claimed responsibility for the hack and said on its website it had accessed six terabytes of data.
The size of the hack suggested prior planning, said Francisco Solano, an executive at IT services and consulting firm Logicalis.
""This did not happen by chance,"" he said.
According to Solano and other analysts consulted by Reuters, the vulnerability exploited by the hackers stemmed from a weakness in a Microsoft server detected last year, known as ProxyShell.

Although solutions to fix the problem were available, the government needed to carry out updates to implement them.
""You have the antidote, but nobody to apply it,"" Solano said, adding that there appeared to be a lack of resources to resolve the issue.
Microsoft did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
On Friday, at his daily news conference, Lopez Obrador said that hackers had exploited a change in the military's IT systems, without giving further details.
The armed forces did not respond to a request for comment.
Governments worldwide have been increasingly targeted by aggressive cyber crime in recent years and have been forced to increase investment and focus on cybersecurity.
In Latin America, Mexico ranks as the country most targeted by cyberattacks in public and private sectors combined, several studies have shown.
Mexican oil company Pemex, National Lottery and National Transparency Platform have been hit by cyberattacks in recent years.
Although Mexico's government has steadily devoted more resources to cybersecurity, the investment is not enough compared to what is needed to ward off attacks, experts said.
Hackers would have needed up to three days to copy the information, said Adolfo Grego, a forensic specialist, also raising questions over why the government did not act sooner.

World,/world/us/,Meta board approves personal security to outgoing executive Sheryl Sandberg,Reuters,2022-10-01 13:38:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/X5AHNBDISRMBJEGPFNLFKM5FQI.jpg,"Sept 30 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) said on Friday its board had approved providing personal security services to former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, citing ""continuing threats to her safety"".
The company, however, did not elaborate on the threats that Sandberg, one of the most powerful women in Silicon Valley, faces. It expects to continue to pay for security services at her residences and during her personal travel from Oct. 1 till June 30 next year.
Sandberg, a close associate of Meta's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, said in June she would depart the social media giant after a 14-year stint when she led the company's often-criticized ads-based business model.
Under Sandberg, the company was also buffeted by revelations in 2018 that U.K. consultancy Cambridge Analytica had improperly acquired data on millions of its U.S. users to target election advertising.

The same year, U.N. human rights investigators said the use of Facebook had played a key role in spreading hate speech that fueled violence against the Rohingya community in Myanmar.
Sandberg will no longer be an employee after Sept. 30 but will remain on its board, the Facebook-owner said in a regulatory filing.
Previously, Meta has spent heavily on the security of its top executives. Last year, the company spent $26.8 million for the personal security and private aircraft of Zuckerberg, it revealed in April.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,Exclusive: Senior Indonesian officials targeted by spyware last year,Fanny Potkin,2022-09-30 21:43:00+00:00,,"Sept 30 (Reuters) - More than a dozen senior Indonesian government and military officials were targeted last year with spy software designed by an Israeli surveillance firm, according to nine people with knowledge of the matter.
Six of the individuals told Reuters they were targeted themselves.
The targets included Chief Economic Minister Airlangga Hartarto, senior military personnel, two regional diplomats, and advisers in Indonesia's defence and foreign affairs ministries, according to the people.
Six of the Indonesian officials and advisers targeted told Reuters they received an email message from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in November 2021 telling them that Apple believed officials were being ""targeted by state-sponsored attackers.""
Apple has not disclosed the identities or number of users targeted. The company declined to comment for this story.
Apple and security researchers have said the recipients of the warnings were targeted using ForcedEntry, an advanced piece of software that has been used by Israeli cyber surveillance vendor NSO Group to help foreign spy agencies remotely and invisibly take control of iPhones. Another Israeli cyber firm, QuaDream, has developed a nearly identical hacking tool, Reuters has reported.
View 2 more stories 
Reuters was unable to determine who made or used the spyware to target the Indonesian officials, whether the attempts were successful, and, if so, what the hackers might have obtained.
The attempt to target Indonesian officials, which has not previously been reported, is one of the biggest cases yet seen of the software being used against government, military and defence ministry personnel, according to cybersecurity experts.
Spokespeople for the Indonesian government, the Indonesian military, the Indonesian Defence Ministry and the Indonesian Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN) did not respond to requests for comments and emailed questions.
A spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said they were unaware of the case and referred Reuters to BSSN.
Alia Karenina, a spokesperson for Airlangga's ministry, said the minister, a top ally of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo, did not receive any notification from Apple about the attempted hack on his official email account.
She said the minister has not installed his official email on his personal phone and uses multiple mobile devices. Alia did not respond to questions on whether other emails used by Airlangga received a warning from Apple.
The use of ForcedEntry, which exploits a flaw in iPhones through a new hacking technique that requires no user interactions, was made public by cybersecurity watchdog Citizen Lab in September 2021. Google security researchers described it as the ""most technically sophisticated"" hacking attack they had ever seen, in a company blog post published in December.
Apple patched the vulnerability in September last year and in November started sending notification messages to what it called a ""small number of users that it discovered may have been targeted.""
In response to Reuters questions, an NSO spokesperson denied the company’s software was involved in the targeting of Indonesian officials, dismissing it as ""contractually and technologically impossible,"" without specifying why. The company, which does not disclose the identity of its customers, says it sells its products only to ""vetted and legitimate"" government entities.
QuaDream did not respond to requests for comment.
In addition to the six officials and advisers who told Reuters they were targeted, a director at a state-owned Indonesian firm that provides weapons to the Indonesian army got the same message from Apple, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The people asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. The company director did not respond to requests for comment.
Within weeks of Apple's notification in November last year, the U.S. government added NSO to the Department of Commerce's 'entity list,' which makes it harder for U.S. companies to do business with it, after determining that the firm's phone-hacking technology had been used by foreign governments to ""maliciously target"" political dissidents around the world.

World,/world/us-vp-harris-visiting-seoul-korean-dmz-hours-after-kims-missile-test-2022-09-28/,"U.S. VP Harris denounces North Korea's 'brutal dictatorship,' Pyongyang fires more missiles",Trevor Hunnicutt,2022-09-30 00:24:00+00:00,,"PANMUNJOM, South Korea, Sept 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said North Korea is a country with a ""brutal dictatorship"", an illegal arms programme and rampant human rights violations, issuing unusually strong criticism during a visit to the inter-Korean border on Thursday.
Soon after Harris wrapped up her Asia trip, North Korea fired two ballistic missiles from north of its capital, Pyongyang, late on Thursday in the direction of her flight from South Korea, the third such launch in five days.
Harris, in her first visit to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, said the heavily armed border area offered a stark reminder of the ""dramatically different paths"" the two sides have taken.
""In the North, we see a brutal dictatorship, rampant human rights violations and an unlawful weapons program that threatens peace and stability,"" Harris said.
""The United States and the world seek a stable and peaceful Korean peninsula where the DPRK is no longer a threat,"" she said, referring to North Korea by the initials of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
View 2 more stories 
Harris was in the DMZ after arriving in the South Korean capital, Seoul, early on Thursday amid simmering regional tension over North Korea's missile launches and China's actions in the Taiwan Strait.
North Korea launched two ballistic missiles from north of Pyongyang into the sea off its east coast, South Korea's military said, about two hours after Harris' flight departed for Washington.  read more 
The missiles flew about 300 km (186.4 miles) reaching a maximum altitude of 50 km (31 miles), Japan's Defence Minister Yasukazu Hamada said, indicating they were likely short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM).
The visit by Harris came amid fears that North Korea is about to conduct a nuclear test. South Korean officials say North Korea has completed preparations for what would be its seventh nuclear test and its first since 2017.  read more 
Harris and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol held talks and condemned North Korea's intensifying nuclear rhetoric and a series of missile tests, the latest of which was conducted on Wednesday.
""They condemned the DPRK's provocative nuclear rhetoric and ballistic missile launches,"" a White House statement said. ""They discussed our response to potential future provocations, including through trilateral cooperation with Japan.""

Harris and Yoon reaffirmed the goal of the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the White House said.
Harris also reaffirmed a U.S.-extended deterrence commitment to its Asian ally, including ""the full range of U.S. defence capabilities"", it added.
Yoon's office said that if the North pushed ahead with serious provocations like a nuclear test, he and Harris agreed to immediately implement ""jointly prepared countermeasures,"" without elaborating.
North Korea codified its right to use pre-emptive nuclear strikes in a new law early this month. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said it is developing nuclear weapons and missiles to defend against U.S. threats.
On Taiwan, Harris underscored that efforts to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait were an ""essential element of a free and open Indo-Pacific"", the White House said.
U.S. President Joe Biden's aides have been shoring up alliances to manage China in the region, including over Taiwan.
But Yoon told CNN in an interview aired on Sunday that in a conflict over Taiwan, North Korea would be more likely to stage a provocation and Seoul and Washington should focus on that concern first.
Aides said Harris' DMZ visit, the first by a Biden administration official, was intended to show unwavering U.S. security commitment to South Korea.
The DMZ, frequently called the last Cold War frontier, was drawn up as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice not a peace treaty.
The trip took on urgency after North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its east coast on Wednesday, the second test since Sunday, while South Korea and the United States are holding naval exercises involving a U.S. aircraft carrier.  read more 
The South Korean and Japanese navies said they would hold trilateral anti-submarine exercises with U.S. forces on Friday, designed to improve their capability to counter evolving North Korean threats, including its submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
Harris and Yoon also discussed changes in U.S. electric vehicle subsidies which South Korea fears could disadvantage its automakers.

europe,/world/europe/,Explainer: Can China broker peace between Russia and Ukraine?,Yew Lun Tian,2023-03-16 06:24:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EDOPAP2ISVK4TOGDA2GBNKTOMM.jpg,"BEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to soon visit Russia's Vladimir Putin and, according to media, hold a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy weeks after China proposed a 12-point plan for peace in Ukraine.
China's foreign ministry has said it is in communication with both sides and, while it has not confirmed Xi's plan for talks with either Putin or Zelenskiy, there is speculation that China may try to get the rivals to the negotiating table.
Following are some of the issues China and others are likely to be taking into account as it considers prospects for peace in Ukraine.
WHY WOULD CHINA TRY TO MEDIATE?
China has traditionally adhered to a principle of not interfering in other countries' conflicts, especially the more distant ones.
But a peace deal struck in Beijing last week between Saudi Arabia and Iran highlights a Chinese aim to project itself as a responsible great power under Xi's stewardship, analysts say.
View 2 more stories 
""Xi would want to be seen on the global stage as a statesman whose influence at least equals that of the U.S. leader,"" said Wang Jiangyu, a law professor at City University of Hong Kong.
China is also eager to deflect criticism that when it comes to Ukraine, it has sided with the aggressor, Russia, which calls its invasion in February last year a ""special military operation"".
Attempting to broker peace is a low-cost venture that can yield high returns for China, even if a quick breakthrough is highly unlikely, analysts say.
China urged both sides to agree to a gradual de-escalation leading to a comprehensive ceasefire in its 12-point paper on the ""political resolution of the Ukraine crisis"".
While the plan called for the protection of civilians and that the sovereignty of all countries be respected, China has refrained from condemning Russia for its invasion.
The plan got lukewarm welcomes in both Russia and Ukraine while the United States and NATO were sceptical.
Ukraine, which says it will only consider peace settlements after Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory, took issue with the plan for not stating that Russia should withdraw behind borders in place since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but later said it was open to ""parts of the plan"".
Russia said it would take a ""nuanced study"" of the plan but did not see any sign for a peaceful resolution for now.
The U.S. said China presented itself publicly as neutral and seeking peace while at the same time reflected Russia's ""false narrative"" about the war, provided it with non-lethal assistance and was considering lethal assistance. China denies that.
NATO said China did not have much credibility as a mediator on Ukraine.
Analysts say it will be hard for China to get Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table, unlike Saudi Arabia and Iran, which presented an easier diplomatic win.
""Saudi Arabia and Iran actually want to talk and improve relations, while Russia and Ukraine don’t, at least for now,"" said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.
However, Xi could act as a backchannel, Yun said, which could start momentum towards talks that for now seem unlikely with both sides hardening their stances in the grinding war.
A fruitless attempt by NATO member Turkey to host dialogue in Istanbul in the weeks after the war began last year underscored the difficulty.
Some analysts say China is in a better position than Turkey to mediate because it has more leverage over Russia.
China is Russia's most important ally and has been buying Russian oil and provided a market for Russian goods shunned by Western countries.
China also has some leverage over Ukraine, which would not want to torpedo the chances of Chinese support for its reconstruction, said Samuel Ramani, a Russia expert at Oxford University.
China expanded trade with Ukraine after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 and did not recognise the annexed territory as Russian, he said.
""Most importantly, Zelenskiy does not want to provoke China so much that they start arming Russia,"" Ramani said.
China's close ties with Russia mean its role will be viewed with deep scepticism. Days before Russia invaded Ukraine, China and Russia announced a ""no-limits"" partnership.
While China has called for peace since the beginning of the war, it has largely reflected the Russian position that NATO threatened Russia with its eastward expansion while Ukraine's Western allies fanned the flames of war by supplying it with tanks and missiles.
Andrew Small, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, said China wants to be seen as doing its part for peace but is not prepared to press Putin to stop the war and sacrifice its relations with Russia.
""Beijing hasn’t thrown its weight around nor sought to coerce Russia into doing anything,"" he said.

xiaomis-slow-shift-india-premium-smartphones-helps-samsung-steal-its-crown-2023-03-16,/technology/xiaomis-slow-shift-india-premium-smartphones-helps-samsung-steal-its-crown-2023-03-16/,Xiaomi's slow shift in India to premium smartphones helps Samsung steal its crown,Munsif Vengattil,2023-03-16 05:46:00+00:00,,"NEW DELHI/LUCKNOW, March 16 (Reuters) - Xiaomi Corp is overhauling its India strategy after misjudging consumer tastes in mobile phones, a costly lapse that has allowed Samsung Electronics to pip the Chinese company to the top spot in the world's second biggest market for the devices.
While Xiaomi remained focused on selling mobile phones under 10,000 rupees ($120), Indian consumers were willing to pay up for better looking models with richer features. South Korea's Samsung launched products to meet those aspirations and offered innovative financing schemes that made them affordable to most.
Those moves have helped Samsung (005930.KS) wrest leadership of India's competitive mobile phones market from Xiaomi (1810.HK), with data from Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research showing it had a 20% market share for the last quarter of 2022 compared to the Chinese company's 18%.
""The Indian market is witnessing a 'premiumisation' trend. (But) Xiaomi has been caught underprepared for the shift with a budget phones-heavy portfolio,"" said Tarun Pathak, a research director at Counterpoint.
View 2 more stories 
The loosening of Xiaomi's vice-like grip on the 626 million Indian smartphone users - the second biggest after China - shows how companies that fail to cater to changing consumer preferences in a fast-growing economy with rising disposable incomes are being punished.
Most famously in India, Tata Motors' (TAMO.NS) 100,000 rupees ($1,200) Nano, billed as the world's cheapest car, was shunned by consumers who associated the low price tag with inferior quality.
Indians' push for more expensive mobile phones to consume videos and other content will also benefit social media app providers such as Meta (META.O), and iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which so far has a tiny market share in the country due to its sole focus on high-end phones, priced from $605 to as high as $2,304, according to its website.
According to Counterpoint, the market share of the sub-$120 phones in India fell to 26% in 2022 from 41% two years ago. And premium phones - priced above 30,000 ($360) - saw their share double to 11% in the same period.
Xiaomi and Samsung both count India as a key growth market, with smartphones their top selling electronic device. The Chinese company recorded total revenue of $4.8 billion in 2021-22 in India, while Samsung registered $10.3 billion in sales, of which $6.7 billion came from smartphones.
Xiaomi, though, is already facing heat in India due to the departures of at least five senior executives, and increased government scrutiny amid frosty relations with neighbouring China. The company has $674 million of its funds frozen by the country's financial crime agency for alleged illegal remittances to foreign entities, which Xiaomi denies.
A Reuters check on product listings on Xiaomi's website showed the mismatch between consumer needs and the products the company has been offering. Xiaomi showed six smartphones priced above $360, compared with Samsung's 16. Under $120, Samsung had seven models, while Xiaomi listed 39 - most of which were shown to be out-of-stock.
And premium phones accounted for only 0%-1% of Xiaomi's total India phone shipments in the last two years, when Samsung's higher-end phones more than doubled their share to 13%, Counterpoint data showed.
But Xiaomi, which has acknowledged it introduced ""too many"" models in the past, is revamping its product line-up to focus on premium smartphones.
It launched in January the Redmi Note 12 whose top-end variant is priced above 30,000 rupees, and more recently the Xiaomi 13 Pro at 79,999 rupees ($970) - its highest priced phone in India. The strategic shift seems to have paid immediate dividends, with the Redmi Note 12 clocking sales of $61 million within two weeks of its launch.
""We have laid out a streamlined and cleaner portfolio with a focused approach to building expertise in the premium segment, and the launch of our latest flagship, Xiaomi 13 Pro, is a step in that direction,"" said its India President Muralikrishnan B.
""We understand that we have a long way to go in this journey, and therefore are bringing in much stronger products.""
A Samsung scheme, run with its financing partners that says it offers ""convenient and assured"" loans, played a significant part in its recent success in India, helping generate $1 billion in device sales last year.
A poster of Samsung's offering that Reuters spotted on a dusty street used by fruit sellers in Uttar Pradesh state said that even those with no loan history, low credit scores or without salary slips could get a phone.
Sanjeev Kumar Verma, owner of a nearby multi-brand phone shop, has benefitted from the company's loan scheme. Speaking to Reuters in his shop, where hundreds of phones are stacked on shelves, Verma said he used to sell five Samsung phones each month, but has quadrupled that to 20 now, 18 of which are via the loan scheme.
Verma, and another smartphone vendor in Mumbai, said that unlike rivals, Samsung required no local address proof, making it easier for migrant workers or those working outside their home state to acquire phones on loans. Samsung did not comment on the remarks by the vendors.
The growth in premium segment phones was much higher in small towns than in big cities, Samsung's India mobile unit head Raju Pullan told Reuters in February, adding almost half the consumers who opted for its financing scheme were first-time loan seekers.
Samsung says its financing app installed on smartphones can lock the device and block outgoing calls for missing loan payments.
Xiaomi has also tapped partnerships to offer loans, calling them a key growth driver for sales of phones priced above 15,000 rupees ($183) and adding it will explore more such offerings.
Muralikrishnan said the company will also open more stores beyond its current network of 20,000 retail partners, and boost local procurement of mobile phone parts, likely reducing costs.
Some industry analysts said the new strategy could help the Chinese company return to solid growth in India.
""Xiaomi has historically enjoyed a strong brand equity, has a robust online and offline channel presence, and can spring a comeback with a potentially strong premium and value-for-money product mix,"" said Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence at CyberMedia Research.

retail-consumer,/business/retail-consumer/,"Food makers, feeling squeezed, pull the plug on slow-selling products",Jessica DiNapoli,2023-02-27 04:59:00+00:00,,"BOCA RATON, Florida/LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Major consumer companies including Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Conagra Brands Inc (CAG.N) are culling product lines to combat sky-high costs and falling consumer demand, their executives said this week.
Many companies started slimming their offerings during the pandemic and are aggressively renewing those efforts, eliminating less-popular items to focus on products on which they can more easily raise prices amid prolonged inflation on food items.
Executives at Nestle SA (NESN.S) and Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) said they have seen billions in savings after ditching the laggards in their product portfolios.
Conagra recently discontinued a Marie Callender's chocolate chip cookie dough cream pie to make room for what the U.S. food company hopes will be a faster-selling no sugar added apple pie.
""No one will have a perfect batting average,"" said Chief Executive Sean Connolly in an interview. ""The key is to have more winners than losers.""

Eliminating less popular products is part of a ""decomplexity program"" underway at Kraft Heinz, its executives said at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York Conference this week. It recently discontinued Heinz Real Mayonnaise.
Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) CEO Dirk Van de Put told Wall Street analysts at the conference that the Oreo maker had clear rules on replacing old products with new ones - ""one in, one out.""
Martin Renaud, a top marketing executive at Mondelez, told Reuters the chocolate manufacturer has ""too many flavors.""
""We sometimes have the tendency to launch a lot of things because they are exciting but we need to be very rigorous,"" Renaud said. As Mondelez adds products with different price points, it adds complexity, he added. ""I am a big advocate of simplicity.""
Companies cull product offerings to make room for new iterations of their most popular items, such as smaller-sized versions for dollar stores or larger ones for warehouse chains like Costco (COST.O), said Justin Cook, U.S. consumer products research leader at Deloitte. Cash-strapped shoppers are more frequently looking for bargains at both types of retailers.
""It’s more expensive to make a lower-volume product,"" Cook said. “If it’s not a high-performing item that people absolutely have to have, companies feel it’s harder to raise price.""
Nestle said cutting products saved 1 billion Swiss francs last year ($1.06 billion), while Unilever said the practice saved $2 billion.
Retailers are also demanding new, fast-selling products to enhance their own faltering sales. Products most likely to get the boot are those with niche or limited popularity.
Heinz Real Mayonnaise has a small share of the global market, according to the research firm Euromonitor.
For some consumers, such cuts can be jarring.
Vinh Banh said in an email he has long used Heinz Real Mayonnaise for sandwiches and deviled eggs. He was disappointed to discover this month that Kraft had killed the product, which it launched in 2018. Banh, 34, from Garland, Texas, said he is on the hunt for any remaining jars he can find.
Kellogg Co (K.N) ditched its line of Special K protein shakes and Nestle axed Lean Cuisine paninis, frozen Sweet Earth Benevolent Bacon and Sweet Earth Vegan Hot Dogs, spokespeople for the companies confirmed.
In some cases, suppliers are bowing to retailer plans to reduce inventory, hoping that cutting product lines will make stores more efficient and less costly to run and stock.
Walmart told Reuters it was seeking more data from suppliers to justify pricing and pushing for more creative ways to defray costs and cushion price hikes to consumers.
""We recognize that price concerns are more elevated at this point in time, but that's where we can lean in and have data driven negotiations with our suppliers,"" Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said.
""I have seen a lot of reduction in inventory purchases this year,"" Kelly Pedersen, a partner at PwC, said at the National Retail Federation conference in January. ""Everyone is prepping for a slowdown.""
Unilever, which makes Magnum and Ben & Jerry's, is slimming the variety of ice cream it sells, finance chief Graeme Pitkethly said this month on an earnings call.
The company has for over two years used artificial intelligence in its 'Polaris' program to help manage its assortment. It credited Polaris as it cut its variety of products by about 20%.
Unilever also trimmed about 5,000 types of products in the personal care category.
Food makers tend to cull products without much fanfare. At the consumer products conference they highlighted new offerings, many of them increasingly popular handheld foods that people can eat while scrolling on phones.
That does not mean consumers don't notice when a beloved item disappears from the shelf.
John Finn, 35, runs a Twitter page called ""Discontinued Foods"" with over 23,000 followers.
""You'd be shocked by the loyalty and personal connections people have to food products,"" he said.

europe,/world/europe/,"North of Bakhmut, another key battle tests Ukraine's defences",Mike Collett-White,2023-03-15 17:06:00+00:00,,"NEAR KREMINNA, March 15 (Reuters) - From a small, non-descript house in a badly bombed village in eastern Ukraine, Andrii ""Tuman"", who goes by his call sign meaning ""fog"", commands his battalion around the clock to hold intensifying Russian attacks at bay.
What Ukrainian forces have long described in the city of Bakhmut is also playing out to the north in Luhansk region - more Russian troops, weapons and aggressive tactics that Moscow hopes will produce a badly needed breakthrough.
Medics reporting to Tuman described heavy casualties in recent weeks, further evidence that the grinding warfare along the front that runs across eastern and southern Ukraine is coming at a high cost to both sides.
The rumble of distant shelling is a constant backdrop as soldiers speed through the village on armoured personnel carriers, while at his base - its windows blacked out - Tuman calls out coordinates for artillery strikes.

""Since the beginning of February, they (the Russians) have conducted something like 40 to 50 attempted assaults,"" the 45-year-old told Reuters in between relaying messages over his radio.
""We have repelled them all,"" added the commander, who identifies himself as Ichkerian, using the historic name for Russia's southern region of Chechnya where he fought in two wars. He rejects Moscow's control over the territory.
Tuman, a stocky figure with a wispy beard, fears the pincer movement that Russian forces are attempting in Bakhmut to surround Ukrainian troops defending it could be repeated, on a larger scale, in his sector of the front.
He said the Russians had switched the direction of attack recently, apparently with the intention of taking the road to Lyman - a town under Ukrainian control that lies to the west of Kreminna, thus forming the top of a pincer.
At the bottom of the attempted encirclement appears to be Soledar, meaning an area far larger than Bakhmut would be vulnerable. This could allow Russia to accelerate west after it has been virtually stuck for months.
""This is the second main direction (after Bakhmut) which is very interesting to the enemy, because if they come to Lyman then beyond, there is Kramatorsk and Sloviansk,"" he said.
""It will pose a 'pincer' threat which is why they are trying to fight for this area so heavily - this is no less important than Bakhmut.""
Some analysts said that while this may be Moscow's intention, they doubted its ability to carry it out given the difficulty Russia has had in conquering the virtually abandoned and badly ruined city of Bakhmut.
""There is indeed an increase in activity and they (the Russians) are trying to move towards Lyman - they managed to advance 4 km in February,"" Ukrainian military analyst Oleksandr Musiyenko said.
""The enemy would need a lot of forces to take this line (Sloviansk-Kramatorsk-Kostiantynivka) and therefore I think it is unlikely, given the losses the Russian troops are already suffering,"" he added.
President Vladimir Putin has framed Moscow's year-long invasion of Ukraine as a defensive pushback against what he sees as a hostile West bent on expanding into territories historically ruled by Russia.
The West and Kyiv dismiss his justification for a war they say is a land grab that has killed tens of thousands of people, laid waste to towns and cities and forced millions to flee.
Tuman's 110th Battalion is active in territory seized by the Russians after Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year and retaken by Ukrainian forces in a counter-offensive last autumn.
Signs of the fighting, and subsequent artillery duels, are everywhere. Homes and shops have been smashed, burned out military vehicles litter the surrounding woods and cannons boom loudly as they fire at Russians positions to the northeast.
For all the carnage, the war has ground to a virtual halt.
Russia has made only incremental gains around Bakhmut, which it has been trying to capture for eight months, and further north.

Tuman said he believed that heavier attacks in February probably constituted Russia's offensive, which Western military experts had been expecting as early as the winter.
Oleksandr, the commander of a unit in Tuman's battalion that is fighting the Russians in frontline trenches, also saw an escalation last month.
""They are pushing hard. They are lobbing mortar bombs at us,"" the 50-year-old told Reuters on Tuesday, describing the Russians advancing in fire teams with another wave behind sent to replace them if they are killed.
""At night they always attack on foot and we sit, looking through our thermal goggles, and shooting them.""
The battalion has gradually expanded its strength, adding drone teams and some heavy weaponry including tanks, and while morale remains high and Tuman a popular leader, commanders also speak of growing fatigue.
""To tell you the truth, we are really exhausted,"" said Serhii Pavlovych, 43, deputy commander in charge of psychological support. ""That's the only serious problem so far. Motivation is very high.""
As for Ukraine's attempt to take the initiative, Tuman thinks a counter-offensive could come soon. Warmer weather has reduced tracks to mud in many places, bogging down heavy vehicles.
""They (Ukrainian authorities) are preparing a lot of reserve battalions and they will be involved in the counter-offensive,"" said Tuman. ""This is spring and the weather is not that favourable ... so I believe in April it's coming.""
Tuman's adult life has been overshadowed by conflict. He said he took part in both wars in the 1990s between Russian troops and separatists after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
He retired from the Ukrainian armed forces in 2007, but re-joined in 2014 when Russian-backed separatists moved into eastern Ukraine. He was badly wounded in an explosion in 2020, but signed up to serve after the full-scale invasion began.
Tuman, who is a Muslim, lost one of his three wives in the hostilities near the capital Kyiv towards the beginning of the invasion. His only son, who was 21, also died around then fighting in the northern town of Sumy.
His motivation comes from exacting revenge on the Russians and supporting his battalion of several hundred soldiers. He declined to specify how many troops he commanded or allow the village where Reuters spent two days following him and his troops to be named.
In another room of his base, two men sat behind laptops and monitored live footage being sent from drones overlooking Russian positions. They use this to identify enemy threats and target them with artillery.
In the surrounding woods, on a dirt road towards the frontline some 8 km (5 miles) away, a two-man medical evacuation team waited for a soldier wounded in fighting to be brought to them by his comrades.
Mykhailo Anest, a 35-year-old medic, said the most intense fighting was in February, when as many as 20 soldiers from the battalion were wounded in a single day.
""There is a lot of artillery and mortar fire,"" he said.
Reuters saw five wounded soldiers brought from the front on Monday, two of them superficially. Anest stabilised a soldier with shrapnel wounds to his right leg in an ambulance van before taking him to a nearby clinic.
Tuman said he needed more artillery firepower, including ammunition, and multiple rocket launchers to sustain pressure on the Russians.
For now, artillery appears to hold the key to defending positions and pinning down the enemy for both sides.
""My guys have been fighting for months,"" he reflected. ""They are dying and they are not seeing a single Russian, because they were all hit by artillery.""

asia-pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Japan battles to persuade its big brands to join military buildout,Tim Kelly,2023-03-15 23:23:00+00:00,,"March 16 (Reuters) - As Tokyo spins up its defence industry for the country's largest military expansion since World War Two, it has run into a challenge: some of Japan's best-known brands are reluctant to invest in the military side of their businesses.
Japan, which renounced war in 1947, last year unveiled a five-year $315 billion military expansion to deter Beijing from using force in the East China Sea amid growing concern that Russia's attack on Ukraine - which it calls a ""special operation"" - could embolden China to invade Taiwan.
But a key part of Tokyo's strategy hinges on persuading commercial firms such as Toshiba Corp (6502.T), Mitsubishi Electric Corp and Daikin Industries Ltd (6367.T), which for decades have quietly armed its Self Defence Forces (SDF), to ramp up production.
In a country with an ingrained public sentiment against militarism, that is proving a hard sell for some of its suppliers, according to Reuters interviews with six government and company officials.
View 2 more stories 
In private meetings with the defence ministry over the last year, some firms have raised concerns such as low profit margins, the financial risk of building manufacturing plants that could be left idle after Japan completes its military expansion, and potential damage to their public image from arms sales, an official directly involved in the talks told Reuters.
The official declined to be identified or attribute the complaints to specific companies, citing the confidential nature of the talks.
The government is preparing legislation that includes raising profit margins on military gear from a few percent to as much as 15%, and the provision of state-owned factories that companies can use to expand production risk-free. Some are concerned that might not be enough.
""Until now, the ministry has taken the defence companies for granted,"" said Masahisa Sato, an influential ruling party lawmaker and former deputy defence minister.
Sato said it was increasingly difficult for Japanese executives to justify defence sales out of ""patriotic duty"" to shareholders focused on more profitable civilian ventures.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's military buildup plan identifies defence manufacturing as a key pillar of national security.
Japan, however, does not have a national defence champion such as Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in the United States or Britain's BAE Systems PLC (BAES.L), and many of the firms supplying the SDF are associated with more mundane products.
At Japan's biggest defence company, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), which is developing Japan's next jet fighter and new longer-range missiles to help deter China, military contracts account for only a tenth of its $29 billion in revenue last year. Most of its business is civilian aircraft components, power plant equipment and factory machines.
Aircon manufacturer Daikin has a munitions sideline; Toshiba, which makes electronic goods such as printers, also produces military-grade batteries; and Mitsubishi Electric makes radars and missiles alongside fridges and vacuum cleaners.
Since early last year, defence officials have been meeting with these firms and other top suppliers, such as car-and-helicopter maker Subaru Corp (7270.T), to urge them to expand their lower-profile military units.
Reuters contacted 15 leading Japanese defence manufacturers, whose CEOs the defence ministry invited to talks with then- defence minister Nobuo Kishi in April, and in January with his successor, Yasukazu Hamada.
Three of them, Mitsubishi Heavy, Mitsubishi Electric and IHI Corp (7013.T), which makes jet engines, bridges and heavy machinery, confirmed they had also taken part in other lower-level discussions.
Five firms did not reply, and the rest declined to say whether they had joined in other discussions. The companies who responded declined to give details of the meetings or any concerns they raised during the talks.
Many companies are reluctant to talk about their defence units, fearing it might put off customers at home, where anti-military sentiment lingers, or overseas, particularly in China, where resentment over Japan's wartime past could be politicised.
Reuters asked 10 of Japan's military suppliers, including Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, Daikin and Subaru, for interviews with their defence unit managers. Only Mitsubishi Electric agreed.
Masahiko Arai, the head of Mitsubishi Electric's defence systems division, said he welcomed government proposals and hoped that contributing to Japan's ""safety and security"" would be beneficial for the firm.
His biggest concern, he said, was what would happen after Japan's five-year military buildup ends, adding that other companies ""are troubled by reputation risk"". His unit accounted for about 4% of the $34 billion in sales the company recorded last business year.
An official at another major Japanese defence supplier, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said being directly involved with regional tensions might be bad for business.
""Reputation risk worries us a lot,"" the official said. ""There have been occasions when our Chinese customers have expressed their discomfort when the topic of defence has come up.""
Despite diplomatic tensions, China is Japan's top trade partner and a major manufacturing base for many Japanese companies.
When Japan ended a decades-long ban on military exports in 2014, it did not spur industry growth because of corporate timidity and overly cautious bureaucrats, analysts say. Mitsubishi Electric is the only company to have sold defence equipment overseas, with a deal in 2020 to supply radars to the Philippines.
Meanwhile, chemical company Daicel (4202.T) announced it would close its pilot-ejection system unit in 2020, and Sumitomo Heavy Industries (6302.T) said it told the defence ministry in 2021 it would stop making machine guns. Daicel cited low profitability, while Sumitomo Heavy said it was difficult to maintain production and train engineers.
An opinion poll published by the government this month suggests there is growing public support for a bigger military as regional tensions with China and North Korea escalate.
In the survey of 1,602 people, 41.5% said they wanted to expand the SDF, up from 29.1% in the last poll five years ago.
Even so, Japanese companies often refer to their military products as ""special equipment,"" the government official said.
Daikin, which generates 90% of its revenue from air conditioning, is among them. It does not list the artillery and mortar shells it makes at its Yodogawa plant in Osaka, western Japan, on its website.
""We aren't keeping our defence business secret; we disclose information about it in a regular way,"" a Daikin spokesperson said. ""It's not about reputation risk.""
On a street outside the barbed-wire topped wall that surrounds the Daikin factory, Reiko Okumoto, 66, said she had lived in the working-class neighbourhood surrounding it for more than 40 years without knowing it produces shells.
""It would be good if (Daikin) could step away from military work,"" she said. ""But given how the world is, I know that's unrealistic.""

finance,/business/finance/,Explainer: Credit Suisse: How did it get to crisis point?,Anshuman Daga,2023-03-16 11:29:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MHKOUXOSZ5L2PFWNO73ENDXXZM.jpg,"March 16 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) said on Thursday it would borrow up to $54 billion from the Swiss central bank to shore up liquidity after a slump in its shares and bonds intensified fears about a global banking crisis. Analysts said they think that might not be enough.
A string of scandals over many years, top management changes, multi-billion dollar losses and an uninspiring strategy can be blamed for the mess that the 167-year-old Swiss lender now finds itself in.
The sell-off in Credit Suisse's shares began in 2021, triggered by losses associated with the collapse of investment fund Archegos and Greensill Capital.
In January 2022, Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned as chairman for breaching COVID-19 rules, just eight months after he was hired to fix the ailing bank.
In July, new CEO and restructuring expert Ulrich Koerner unveiled a strategic review - but failed to win over investors.
View 2 more stories 
An unsubstantiated rumour on an impending failure of the bank in the autumn sent customers fleeing.
Credit Suisse confirmed last month that clients had pulled 110 billion Swiss francs of funds in the fourth quarter while the bank suffered its biggest annual loss of 7.29 billion Swiss francs since the financial crisis. In December, Credit Suisse had tapped investors for 4 billion Swiss francs.
On Wednesday, Saudi National Bank (1180.SE), the bank's top backer, told reporters it could not give more money to the bank as it was constrained by regulatory hurdles, while saying it was happy with the bank's turnaround plan.
The shares have lost 75% over the past one year.
Credit Suisse has said it would borrow up to $54 billion to shore up liquidity and investor confidence but some analysts believe that is unlikely to be enough to soothe investors.
Winning the backing of strategic investors could be one option to shore up market confidence. It counts Qatar Investment Authority and Saudi conglomerate Oyalan Group among its investors.
In the early days of the global financial crisis in 2008, UBS took on Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC as an investor but the stake sell-down ultimately resulted in a loss for GIC.
Divesting stakes in various assets is an option as Credit Suisse owns an asset management business and a stake in SIX Group, which runs the Zurich stock exchange.
Credit Suisse has pivoted to a strategy to cater to rich clients while cutting back on its volatile investment banking business and has already announced plans to spin it off.
The bank ranks among the world's largest wealth managers and crucially it is one of 30 global systemically important banks, whose failure would cause ripples through the entire financial system.
Credit Suisse has a local Swiss bank, wealth management, investment banking and asset management operations. It has just over 50,000 employees and 1.6 trillion Swiss francs in assets under management at the end of 2021.
With more than 150 offices in around 50 countries, Credit Suisse is the private bank for a large number of entrepreneurs, rich and ultra rich individuals and companies.

uk,/world/uk/,Britain's tax take risks blowing green energy off target,Susanna Twidale,2023-03-13 16:20:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CIOYCWW3MJPNBKDUWME2MLB3GI.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - A cap on revenue and the lack of the kind of incentives offered to oil explorers are blocking the development of renewable energy in Britain, say industry officials who are pressing for changes ahead of this week's budget.
The British government has set targets for major increases in wind generation, for instance, as it seeks to meet a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 and to become more independent of imported energy following the supply disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Representatives of the renewable energy sector say those goals could be missed without policy changes, especially as other countries are doing more to attract investment in green power.
Among the most contentious issues is Britain's Electricity Generator Levy (EGL), which the government implemented from the start of this year to combat high energy prices, and which the industry says is a ""de facto windfall tax"".
View 2 more stories 
Rod Wood, managing director at wind energy developer Community Wind Power, is among those seeking changes to the EGL in Britain's March 15 budget.
“The taxation (EGL) is going to kibosh renewable targets the UK has set,” he said.
Specifically, he wants it to include an investment allowance like the one oil and gas companies receive under their equivalent Energy Profits Levy (EPL).
The EPL includes an investment incentive that means oil and gas firms can offset from their tax bill 91.40 pounds in every 100 pounds spent on new production.
British government targets include increasing offshore wind capacity to 50 gigawatts (GW) from around 14 GW now.
Wood said without tax changes, his company would be forced to halt development of three onshore Scottish projects, totalling 1.2 GW, which by 2025 could be generating enough power for more than a million homes.
“When you look at how much costs have gone up in the UK versus stimulus packages on offer in the U.S., it's not hard to see anyone who can will be relocating business there,” he said.
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration last year signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which delivers a support package for clean technology worth $370 billion.
Other developers say the combination of levies, high energy prices, supply chain bottlenecks, inflation and interest rate rises means their projects are under threat.
Denmark's Orsted last week said its Hornsea 3 project in the North Sea, which at around 3 GW would be the world's largest windfarm when built, could be paused unless it gets support such as tax breaks because costs have surged.
Another major project is the Vattenfall group's Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone.
Rob Anderson, its project director, said the British government ""must show its support for the sector in next week’s budget through capital allowances”.
Under the EGL, a 45% tax on low-carbon power generators applies to revenue on power generation at an aggregate price above 75 pounds ($89) per megawatt hour (MWh).
With wholesale electricity prices around 120 pounds/MWh, the level at which the tax kicks in is too low, Wood said, citing more generous levies in Europe.
The European Commission has set a revenue cap on electricity companies, requiring them to hand over any excess revenue to national governments they get for selling their non-gas generated power over 180 euros ($190)/MWh.
Oil and gas producers, which have been subject to a windfall tax since May 2022, also want change.
They say the Energy Profit Levy (EPL) windfall tax which last year raised the tax rate to 75%, one of the world's highest, is shrinking producers' access to funding.
Renewable developers say the oil and gas sector has for years enjoyed tax breaks, while green groups say the sector should no longer be given any incentives given the need to phase out fossil fuel.
The British fossil fuel industry says it is still necessary to invest in the ageing North Sea basin and home-grown fuel is far less polluting than importing oil and gas from distant places where supply might be more easily disrupted.
It also says higher tax rates should kick in only when profits are derived from prices above a yet-to-be-agreed price floor, based on an historic average, rather than the entire profit regardless of price as is currently the case.
The industry also wants the tax to apply to realised prices, which include hedging results, rather than broader market prices.
Many oil and gas producers hedge large chunks of their output to comply with lenders' demands, which means their exposure to market price changes is limited.
Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt, in a meeting in December, rebuffed calls from the oil and gas industry to amend the windfall tax.
Further meetings, including in late February with Treasury officials have taken place, but no change was expected from the March 15 budget, two industry sources said, declining to be named.
Meanwhile, Britain's biggest oil and gas producer Harbour , has announced job cuts and shunned the latest licensing round. TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) cut its UK investment programme by a quarter.

finance,/business/finance/,On the precipice: How Credit Suisse's day of drama unfolded,Reuters,2023-03-16 11:01:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WDI3V54T3NIN5FBUNDNI5SXD4I.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - On March 16, 2008, Bear Stearns was forced into the arms of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) in a dramatic weekend rescue after Wall Street turned on the investment bank, fearing it would collapse.
Fifteen years later, Credit Suisse Group AG found itself on a similar precipice. The Swiss lender, weakened by a series of scandals, had seen its already-low share price fall even further after the failure in recent days of two U.S. banks, SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O).
So, when Saudi National Bank (1180.SE) Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy said his bank, the largest investor in Credit Suisse, could not give it more money, investors ran for the exits.
It didn't matter that Saudi National Bank also gave a reason - further investment would leave it with more than 10% of Credit Suisse's shares, a regulatory hurdle - and that it said it was happy with the Swiss bank's turnaround plan.

Nor did it matter that Credit Suisse Chief Executive Ulrich Koerner had been out over the past few days trying to reassure investors that the bank was strong, with enough capital and liquidity.
By the time traders in New York were switching on screens on Wednesday, Credit Suisse had lost more than a fifth of its value. Its five-year credit default swaps, an indicator of credit stress, spiked to a new record high.
The Swiss lender, investors saw, was not only much bigger than the regional U.S. banks that had failed in the past few days, but it was also an important cog in global financial plumbing and deemed sysemically important. They worried its problems could ripple through global markets in unexpected and devastating ways.
Regulators watched the stock fall with concern while rivals and clients scanned their books to see what exposure they had to the bank, according to interviews with multiple industry sources and statements from regulators. Some urged their counterparts in Switzerland to act quickly to save the bank.
""The thing that's keeping markets on their toes is we had SVB, then Signature Bank closing down; now it's Credit Suisse,"" said Robert Carnell, ING's head of research for Asia Pacific. ""What next?""
Credit Suisse did not comment for this story but noted recent interviews given by its CEO saying the bank was strong.
As the day progressed on Wednesday, a crisis of confidence enveloped Switzerland's second-biggest bank.
An asset management company in New York was assessing its trading risk, examining what open positions it had with Credit Suisse, said a source at the company.
At a rival bank, an executive reported seeing more Credit Suisse deposits flowing in.
Credit Suisse's bankers were fielding queries from corporate clients who were checking on their liquidity positions with the Swiss bank, two banking sources said.
Large corporate clients had calls and meetings with bankers to assess and understand the evolving situation with the bank and the sector in a so-called ""welfare check"", the sources said.
Staff struggled on through the drama.
""People are nervous, but everyone is still doing their job,"" said one source familiar with the matter.
Not all clients said they were concerned. A corporate treasury executive at a major U.S. firm with hedging business with Credit Suisse reported feeling comfortable with the bank despite what was going on.
A top U.S. bank also kept dealing with Credit Suisse as a counterparty but was carefully managing its exposure, which was small, according to a source.
Bankers were more concerned about contagion or unexpected effects of the Swiss lender's troubles that were not yet understood, one banking source said.
Pressure intensified on the bank. A major European bank held talks with Credit Suisse, urging the lender to seek an urgent central bank liquidity backstop, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions.
By late afternoon in New York, there was relief. Swiss regulators had thrown Credit Suisse a financial lifeline.
Markets seemed to calm, but the fresh drama around Credit Suisse jogged memories that the financial system was not out of the woods yet.
""The response was good. It stopped the sort of immediate burning fire, but I don't get the feeling the whole fire is out,"" said one banking lawyer, referring to the Swiss backstop. ""It's smoldering.""
Late on Wednesday, as the trading day swung to Asia, Credit Suisse came out with its own new plan, to ""strengthen its liquidity"" with debt and cash offers.
""We welcome the statement of support,"" Credit Suisse said.

Athletes from Russia and its neighbour Belarus, which aided Moscow's invasion of Ukraine a year ago, have been banned from many international competitions since.
In some sports where they are still competing they are doing so without their national flags or anthems.
The IBA, which is headed by Russian businessman Umar Kremlev, lifted sanctions on the two nations last year and is allowing their athletes to compete as usual.

The IOC issued sanctions against Russia and Belarus after last year's invasion of Ukraine but is reluctant to exclude their athletes from the Olympics entirely for fear of a return to the boycotts of the Cold War era.
They set out a pathway in January for competitors from Russia and its ally Belarus to earn Olympic slots through Asian qualifying and to compete as neutral athletes in Paris next year.

The 121-metre (396 ft) ""al-Mansur"", a symbol of Saddam's wealth and power when it was built in the 1980s, is today a destination for sightseers and fisherman who clamber aboard the wreck to picnic and drink tea.
""When it was owned by the former president, no one could come close to it,"" said fisherman Hussein Sabahi, who enjoys ending a long day on the river with a cup of tea aboard the wreck.
""I can’t believe that this belonged to Saddam and now I'm the one moving around it,"" he said.
Saddam issued orders for the yacht, which he never boarded, to leave its mooring at Umm Qasr to Basra for safekeeping a few weeks after the invasion got underway on March 20, 2003.

But it was targeted by U.S.-led forces, and later capsized in the Shatt al-Arab waterway as it fell into decay.
In the turmoil that followed Saddam’s downfall, the yacht was stripped bare and looted, with everything from its chandeliers and furniture to parts of its metal structure removed.
One of three yachts owned by Saddam, the yacht could accommodate up to 200 guests and was equipped with a helipad.
U.S. officials estimated in 2003 that Saddam and his family may have amassed up to $40 billion in ill-gotten funds.
Another of his yachts has been turned into a hotel in Basra.
Though some Iraqis say the wreck should be preserved, successive governments have not allocated funds to recover it.

The mishap paused Blue Origin's only active rocket at the center of its space tourism and microgravity research business. For those missions, New Shepard launches a capsule to the edge of space to float in microgravity for roughly five minutes before making a parachute-assisted return landing.
New Shepard has flown several crews of paying tourists and company-sponsored guests to the edge of space, including Blue Origin's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos on the rocket's inaugural flight in 2021.

The company expected to complete a ""technical review"" of the New Shepard failure by December last year, a Blue Origin executive told the Washington Post in November, but it is unclear if that review has been completed. Cornell declined to provide details on where the investigation stands.
The U.S. Federal Aviation administration, which regulates commercial launch site safety, is overseeing Blue Origin's investigation and must approve of its findings.
""Because we're doing this in coordination with the FAA, I can't get into those details,"" Cornell said when asked about investigation delays. ""I'm not sure if we're gonna release the details. It's something that we have to coordinate with the FAA.""
""The FAA does not prohibit commercial space operators from publicly discussing information about open mishap investigations,"" said FAA spokesman Steve Kulm in response to a Reuters inquiry.
The FAA asks companies to ""coordinate the release of factual information for awareness and to ensure any mention of the FAA’s oversight role in the investigation is properly portrayed,"" Kulm added.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/science/,OneWeb 'moves on' from Soyuz-stranded satellites as its network nears completion,Joey Roulette,2023-03-15 16:48:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - OneWeb, nearing completion of its internet-from-space network, has largely given up on trying to retrieve satellites worth $50 million in a dispute related to the Ukraine conflict, the satellite operator's chief executive said this week.
The company will launch from India the final batch of satellites needed to complete its global network on March 26 and said it expects to begin global service for new government and enterprise customers shortly after.
The British government-backed company in March last year canceled a planned launch of 36 broadband satellites aboard Russia's Soyuz rocket after Russia's space chief halted the mission in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Dmitry Rogozin said at the time that his agency wanted OneWeb to provide guarantees that its satellites were not going to be used against Russia. Western sanctions following the invasion have impacted Moscow's space industry, and Rogozin also demanded that Britain sell its stake in OneWeb.

OneWeb refused and canceled all its future Soyuz launches. But it has been unable to retrieve the satellites from their Soyuz launchsite at the Russia-owned Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The satellites are worth a combined $50 million, OneWeb chief executive Neil Masterson said Tuesday.
""I spend no time thinking about it. We've completely moved on,"" Masterson said, deferring any future retrieval efforts to government authorities. ""There is value getting them back, but I can tell you that I'm not getting them back any time soon.""
The dispute was a temporary setback to OneWeb's plan to create an initial constellation of 588 satellites to provide global broadband coverage, forcing the company to quickly secure new rocket agreements with the Indian Space Research Organisation and SpaceX.
OneWeb, which manufactures at least two satellites per day, had another batch of 36 satellites ready for launch soon after cancelling Soyuz, Masterson said. ""The bigger issue for us was not so much the satellites, it was securing the launches,"" he said.
Asked if Russia's custody of the commercially sensitive technology raises security or competitive concerns for OneWeb, Masterson said: ""It's not a material problem.""
Even if Russia were to reverse-engineer the satellites it would pose no threat to the business, Masterson said, citing the company's extensive supply chain, spectrum access, and other foundations of the satellite network.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/science/,Brazilian researchers find 'terrifying' plastic rocks on remote island,Sergio Queiroz,2023-03-16 00:37:00+00:00,,"TRINDADE ISLAND, Brazil, March 15 (Reuters) - The geology of Brazil's volcanic Trindade Island has fascinated scientists for years, but the discovery of rocks made from plastic debris in this remote turtle refuge is sparking alarm.
Melted plastic has become intertwined with rocks on the island, located 1,140 km (708 miles) from the southeastern state of Espirito Santo, which researchers say is evidence of humans' growing influence over the earth's geological cycles.
""This is new and terrifying at the same time, because pollution has reached geology,"" said Fernanda Avelar Santos, a geologist at the Federal University of Parana.
Santos and her team ran chemical tests to find out what kind of plastics are in the rocks called ""plastiglomerates"" because they are made of a mixture of sedimentary granules and other debris held together by plastic.
""We identified (the pollution) mainly comes from fishing nets, which is very common debris on Trinidade Island's beaches,"" Santos said. ""The (nets) are dragged by the marine currents and accumulate on the beach. When the temperature rises, this plastic melts and becomes embedded with the beach's natural material.""

Trindade Island is one of the world's most important conservation spots for green turtles, or Chelonia mydas, with thousands arriving each year to lay their eggs. The only human inhabitants on Trindade are members of the Brazilian navy, which maintains a base on the island and protects the nesting turtles.
""The place where we found these samples (of plastic) is a permanently preserved area in Brazil, near the place green turtles lay their eggs,"" Santos said.
The discovery stirs questions about humans' legacy on the earth, says Santos.
""We talk so much about the Anthropocene, and this is it,"" Santos said, referring to a proposed geological epoch defined by humans' impact on the planet's geology and ecosystems.
""The pollution, the garbage in the sea and the plastic dumped incorrectly in the oceans is becoming geological material ... preserved in the earth's geological records.""

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/sports/,Spanish judge agrees to take on Barcelona's refereeing scandal case,Fernando Kallas,2023-03-15 13:55:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/6FHDCIEYCJIIHD7NGHVB2SDSB4.jpg,"MADRID, March 15 (Reuters) - A Barcelona court has agreed to take on the case over alleged payments made by Barcelona soccer club to a company owned by a senior refereeing official with a view to influencing match results.
The regional court said on Wednesday it would investigate Barcelona and two of the LaLiga club's former presidents, Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu, over the crimes of corruption in sports, unfair administration and falsehood in documents.
After prosecutors filed the complaint on Friday over alleged payments of more than 7.3 million euros from 2001 to 2018 to firms owned by Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, State Attorney General Alvaro Garcia Ortiz ordered on Tuesday that the case be transferred to anti-corruption prosecutor's office due to the high-profile nature of the allegations that could constitute significant corruption offences.
The Spanish government and Real Madrid soccer club said they would join the complaint as soon as the judge took it on.
View 2 more stories 
Negreira was vice-president of the refereeing committee of the Spanish Football Association from 1993 to 2018 under then president Victoriano Sanchez Arminio.
Prosecutors allege that under a secret agreement and ""in exchange for money"", Negreira favoured Barcelona ""in the decisions taken by referees in the games played by the club, as well as in the results of the competitions"".
Reuters has been unable to reach Negreira for comment.
A senior Barcelona official told Reuters on Friday the club had expected the prosecutors' complaint and described it as ""nothing more than an absolutely preliminary investigative hypothesis"".
The official said the club would fully cooperate with the investigation and it reiterated that ""they have never bought any referee nor have tried to influence any official's decisions"".
In a statement last month the football club denied wrongdoing, saying it had paid an external consultant who supplied it with ""technical reports related to professional refereeing"". It was a common practice among professional football clubs, it said.
""I am looking forward to confronting all the scoundrels who are tarnishing our shield,"" Barcelona president Joan Laporta told an event held by the club with the captains of the different Barcelona teams on Monday.
The prosecutors' complaint focuses on 2.9 million euros paid from 2014 to 2018 and alleges that Barcelona, with the help of former presidents Sandro Rosell and Josep Maria Bartomeu, reached a ""confidential verbal agreement"" with Negreira.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/sports/,"Infantino re-elected FIFA president, telling critics 'I love you all'",Philbert Girinema,2023-03-16 10:11:00+00:00,,"KIGALI, March 16 (Reuters) - Gianni Infantino was re-elected as FIFA president during the 73rd Congress in Kigali on Thursday, promising record revenues in the next four-year cycle of $11 billion as he called for more football to be played around the world.
Infantino stood unopposed, making his re-election as head of football's governing body a formality, even if he is not universally popular among member associations amid controversies including the treatment of migrant workers in the run-up to last year's World Cup in Qatar and a failed plan to play the tournament every two years.
""It is an incredible honour and privilege, and a great responsibility,"" Infantino said. ""I promise to continue serving FIFA and football around the world.
""To those that love me, and I know there are many, and those who hate me ... I love you all.""
Infantino confirmed FIFA’s income hit record levels in the last cycle from 2019-22, but promised to substantially raise this again on the back of expanded men’s and women’s World Cup tournaments and the introduction of a 32-team Club World Cup.
View 2 more stories 
""Revenues rose to a record $7.5 billion (to 2022) in a period that was hit by COVID-19. When I arrived, FIFA reserves stood at around $1 billion, today they are at almost $4 billion,"" Infantino said.
""We promise new record revenues for the next cycle of $11 billion, and the new Club World Cup is not included in that figure, so it could increase by a couple of billion (more).""
Infantino said FIFA would continue to review the transfer system to ""improve transparency"" and suggested the organisation might discuss a salary cap.
""We must improve our regulations and the FIFA statutes. We will continue to evolve our good governance principles and look at the transfer system, and maybe have a discussion to improve transparency of transfer fees and salaries.
""It might be necessary to introduce a cap, we have to think how we can do that. We will look at it with all stakeholders and see what we can do.""
Amid the financial success of his seven years in office, Infantino has also courted controversy that has made him unpopular with some member associations.
He accused critics of host Qatar’s human rights record of hypocrisy and racism at the World Cup.
The tournament in the desert state led to a significant amount of political discussion around the host's treatment of migrant labour, its approach to LGBT rights and FIFA's threats to penalise players for political statements.
This included the banning of the anti-discrimination ""One Love"" armband which drew anger from a number of quarters.
FIFA has previously spoken about setting up a legacy fund to assist and compensate migrant workers who helped build the stadiums and other infrastructure for the World Cup, but as yet no concrete plans have been revealed and Infantino made no mention of it in his address.
He did suggest that FIFA had cleaned up its act with regards to governance.
""Every single dollar that is being invested in projects and associations will undergo an independent audit. Money just doesn’t get lost any more.
""That is why the institutions have regained their trust in FIFA. The Department of Justice of the United States has given us more than $200 million back that was stolen by corrupt officials. We have re-invested that in football.""
Player welfare groups have questioned FIFA's decision to expand the men's World Cup from 64 to 104 games, but Infantino says there needs to be more football played around the world.
""When I hear there is too much football, yes, maybe in some places, but not everywhere. In fact, in most parts of the world there is not enough football played.
""We need way more and not less competitions, we want football to develop worldwide.
""We are discussing organising a women’s Club World Cup and a FIFA World Series in March every two years, when teams are free from playing qualifiers.""
Infantino was first elected in an Extraordinary Congress in 2016 following the resignation of his predecessor Sepp Blatter, and retained his position unopposed three years later.
But this counts as his second term of office and he will therefore be available for a third and final term in four years' time.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/are-they-real-south-korean-girl-band-offers-glimpse-into-metaverse-2023-03-14/,Are they for real? South Korean girl band offers glimpse into metaverse,Hyunsu Yim,2023-03-14 11:10:00+00:00,,"SEOUL, March 14 (Reuters) - Less than two months ago, the first music video by South Korean girl quartet MAVE: went viral, racking up nearly 20 million views on YouTube and setting the stage for potential global success.
At first glance, MAVE: looks like any other idolised K-pop band - except it only exists virtually. Its four members - SIU, ZENA, TYRA and MARTY - live in the metaverse, their songs, dances, interviews and even their hairstyles created by web designers and artificial intelligence.
""When I first saw Mave, it was a little confusing to tell whether they were humans or virtual characters,"" said Han Su-min, a 19-year-old in Seoul. ""Because I use metaverse platforms with my friends often, I feel like I could become their fan.""
The group's almost human-like avatars provide an early glimpse of how the metaverse is likely to evolve as South Korea's entertainment and tech industries join hands in the fledgling technology.
View 2 more stories 
It also represents a serious push by tech giant Kakao Corp (035720.KS) to become a dominant force in entertainment. Apart from backing MAVE:, Kakao launched a 1.25 trillion won ($960 million) tender offer last week to buy South Korean K-pop pioneer SM Entertainment (041510.KQ).
SM is home to popular K-pop groups such as Girls' Generation, H.O.T., EXO, Red Velvet, Super Junior, SHINee, NCT Dream and Aespa.
Kakao declined comment on how it would balance the demands of managing real and virtual bands.
The company's bet on the metaverse bucks a global trend. Big tech companies from Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc META.O to China's Tencent Holdings 0700.HK are now reining in their spending on virtual worlds to ride out the economic downturn.
Kakao has said earlier that it has invested 12 billion won in Metaverse Entertainment, a subsidiary it formed with gaming firm Netmarble Corp (251270.KS) to create MAVE:.
But the company declined to make any income forecasts from the venture.
MAVE: is an ""ongoing"" project to explore new business opportunities and find ways to work around technological challenges, said Chu Ji-yeon, who heads Metaverse Entertainment.

The concept is not new in South Korea. In 1998, virtual singer Adam was launched, and two decades later, K-pop girl group K/DA, inspired by characters from video game League of Legends, also made a debut. Neither took off.
But South Korean technology has made much progress since then in creating virtual characters. MAVE: is more natural-looking thanks to new tools and artificial intelligence that developers used to create facial expressions and small details like streaks in hair, viewers say.
With the aid of an AI voice generator, its members can speak four languages - Korean, English, French and Bahasa. But they can't speak in response to prompts and have to rely on scripts prepared by humans.
The group's voices heard in the debut single ""Pandora"" and the choreography in the music video were created by human performers and processed by motion capture and real-time 3D rendering technologies.
Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic aided the growth of such virtual characters, as many K-pop companies pivoted to online content to satiate home-bound fans.
""Fans became more used to consuming non-face-to-face content and communication with their idol groups for nearly three years,"" said Lee Jong-im, a pop culture critic who teaches at Seoul National University. ""It seems they have become more accepting of the concept that virtual and actual idol groups can integrate.""
While virtual groups like MAVE: are making headlines for their novelty, questions remain over whether they can match the interaction between conventional popular bands and their legions of fans.
""Virtual idols will move exactly as they are manufactured. And without any unpredictability, they will become something close to video technology, not K-pop,"" said Lee Gyu-tag, an associate professor of cultural studies at George Mason University Korea.
Yet, MAVE:'s creators and entertainment industry officials are upbeat about its potential.
""With so many comments received from all over the world, I've realized that viewers do want something new and that they are rather open-minded,"" said Roh Shi-yong, chief producer of a weekly music show on local TV station MBC that aired MAVE:'s performance twice.
""The metaverse era is coming.""

Legal,/legal/transactional/,"India allows foreign law firms to set up offices, move seen as 'game changer'",Arpan Chaturvedi,2023-03-15 11:24:00+00:00,,"NEW DELHI, March 15 (Reuters) - India will allow foreign law firms to set up offices to offer corporate law and M&A services to clients and hire local lawyers to beef up operations, in a major move seen as reshaping the landscape of a sector long dominated by local firms.
The Bar Council of India in new rules issued on Wednesday said foreign lawyers and law firms can also advise on international arbitration cases on a reciprocal basis, meaning lawyers from those countries which allow similar opportunities to Indian lawyers can practice.
Foreign lawyers, however, will only be allowed to advise on foreign or international laws and not be permitted to appear before any Indian courts and tribunals.
They can practice ""corporate work such as joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions, intellectual property matters ... on (a) reciprocal basis"" the rules stated.
""Opening up of law practice ... would go a long way in helping legal profession/domain grow in India.""
View 2 more stories 
The new rules allow foreign firms to hire Indian lawyers and also engage others for advice on local legal matters.
The entry of foreign law firms into India has been a contentious issue and the Bar Council for years opposed the move fearing the impact on local lawyers. India has hundreds of law firms both large and small, which advise domestic and global companies including Facebook and Google.
The new rules pave the way for global law firms such as Latham & Watkins, DLA Piper, and Baker McKenzie to set up offices in India.
In a statement, Baker McKenzie said India's ""landmark announcement"" opens up possibilities that ""are hugely exciting.""
However, Rohit Jain, Managing Partner at India's Singhania & Co, said the rules won't translate to overnight mushrooming of foreign firms as their entry will be subject to reciprocity clauses which will require assessment of how other nations treat Indian lawyers in their jurisdiction.
For years, the Indian legal system has only allowed foreign lawyers to operate on a fly-in and fly-out basis for advising clients.
""The change in the Bar Council Rules will be a game changer for Indian lawyers ... competition will improve,"" said Mohit Saraf, founder of Indian law firm Saraf and Partners.

Legal,/legal/us-charges-exiled-chinese-businessman-guo-wengui-with-fraud-2023-03-15/,U.S. charges exiled Chinese businessman Guo Wengui with $1 bln fraud,Jonathan Stempel,2023-03-16 08:08:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday charged Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman with ties to former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, with leading a complex conspiracy to defraud Guo's online followers out of more than $1 billion.
Authorities said Guo, with help from longtime financial adviser Kin Ming Je, cheated thousands of followers since 2018 by promising ""outsized"" investment returns, but diverting much of their money to fund lavish lifestyles for himself and his family.
The alleged improper purchases included a $37 million yacht, a 50,000 square-foot mansion in northern New Jersey, a $3.5 million Ferrari for Guo's son, a $62,000 TV, and two $36,000 mattresses, according to authorities.
Guo, 52, was charged with 11 criminal counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and concealment of money laundering, after ""lining his pockets with the money he stole,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in Manhattan said in a statement.
View 2 more stories 
The defendant was arrested on Wednesday morning, and pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge Katharine Parker, who ordered him detained without bail.
Guo wore a black shirt, black pants and brown shoes to the courtroom. He was not handcuffed, and brought his hands together in a prayer sign toward spectators before being led out.
Lawyers for Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They will propose a ""robust bail package,"" according to Tamara Giwa, a federal public defender who represented Guo at Wednesday's hearing. His next court appearance is April 4.
Guo, who has used other names like Ho Wan Kwok and Miles Kwok, has been a business associate of Bannon, who was arrested in a fraud case in August 2020 while aboard Guo's yacht, the Lady May.
Trump pardoned Bannon in the final hours of his presidency. Bannon is not accused of wrongdoing in Guo's criminal case.
The U.S. Department of Justice said it seized and is seeking the forfeiture of $634 million of Guo's alleged fraud proceeds from 21 bank accounts, including several at the now-closed Silvergate Bank.
It said it also seized assets purchased with proceeds from Guo's alleged fraud, including a Lamborghini Aventador, and wants Guo to forfeit the yacht.

The criminal charges carry several decades of potential prison time. Guo also faces related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges.
Je, who lives in London and is also known as William Je, faces the same 11 criminal counts plus an obstruction charge. He is at large.
Guo is a prominent critic of China's Communist Party.
He left that country in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown under President Xi Jinping, and has been accused there of crimes including bribery and money laundering. Guo has denied wrongdoing.
Following Guo's arrest, a fire broke out on the 18th floor at the Sherry-Netherland hotel, where he has an apartment, on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
A spokesman for New York City's fire department said no injuries were reported and officials were investigating. He declined to say if they were examining any connection to Guo's arrest.
Court papers filed on Wednesday described a web of offerings that according to prosecutors targeted investors aligned with Guo's policy objectives in China, and inclined to believe the self-proclaimed billionaire when it came to investing.
""We allege that Guo was a serial fraudster,"" SEC enforcement chief Gurbir Grewal said in a statement.
Prosecutors said that in one offering, Guo raised $262 million through a cryptocurrency ""ecosystem"" called the Himalaya Exchange, which promised a so-called H Coin, also known as Himalaya Coin or HCN, with an estimated $27 billion valuation.
The indictment quoted from an October 2021 video in which Guo allegedly said 20% of H Coin's value was backed by gold, and that he would fully reimburse investors who lost money.
""Whoever loses money, I will bear it,"" Guo was quoted as saying.
In February 2022, Guo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Connecticut after a New York judge ordered him to pay $134 million for moving the Lady May out of a lender's reach.

Trump, who has denied having an affair with Daniels, is seeking the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2024. The Manhattan District Attorney's office has given him a chance to testify before the grand jury probing the payment, a sign prosecutors may be close to bringing charges against him.
""Stormy responded to questions and has agreed to make herself available as a witness, or for further inquiry if needed,"" Clark Brewster, Daniels' lawyer, wrote on Twitter.
In a tweet, Daniels thanked Brewster ""for helping me in our continuing fight for truth and justice.""
A spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to comment.
Susan Necheles, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Daniels' talks with prosecutors. Trump has denied the affair ever happened and has called Bragg's probe a politically-motivated witch hunt.

Joseph Tacopina, another Trump lawyer, said earlier this week Trump did not plan to appear before the grand jury, but that a decision had not yet been made.
The investigation centers on a $130,000 payment Daniels - whose real name is Stephanie Clifford - received in October 2016 from Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer.
Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to campaign finance violations tied to his arranging hush payments to Daniels and another woman, among other crimes. He has said Trump directed him to make the payment.
Cohen testified before the grand jury on Monday and again on Wednesday, according to his lawyer, Lanny Davis. Grand jury proceedings are not public.

In a complaint filed on Monday night in Manhattan federal court, a Detroit-based pension fund said Amgen artificially inflated its stock price by concealing the dispute over its international tax strategy between July 2020 and April 2022.
The IRS has accused Amgen of underreporting taxes from 2010 to 2015, mainly for attributing what should have been U.S. taxable income to a Puerto Rico unit that houses its main manufacturing business and produces many of its drugs.
Though Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, it is considered a foreign country for corporate tax purposes. Amgen's top-selling product is the arthritis drug Enbrel.
The plaintiff, Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund, said Amgen's share price fell 6.5% on Aug. 4, 2021, and 4.3% on April 28, 2022, because the company waited until those dates to disclose its potential liabilities.

""Defendants failed to take any meaningful accrual or otherwise reveal the staggering amount of back taxes and penalties claimed by the U.S. government,"" causing shareholder losses when the truth was revealed, the fund said.
Chief Executive Robert Bradway and Chief Financial Officer Peter Griffith are also defendants.
Amgen on Tuesday said it was reviewing the complaint.
The Thousand Oaks, California-based company has said the IRS demands are without merit, and the agency overstated the dispute by billions of dollars. It has also said it believes its tax reserves are appropriate.
Amgen is among drugmakers that have been examined by the Senate Finance Committee over their tax practices.
Its effective tax rate was 10.8% in 2022, lower than average among large U.S. drug companies.
The IRS is also examining Amgen for the years 2016 to 2018 on issues similar to the 2010 to 2015 period.

The lawsuit seeks an order blocking Nexstar, the largest local TV station owner in the United States, from allegedly colluding with Mission Broadcasting Inc and White Knight Broadcasting Inc in fee negotiations with DirecTV.
Pay-TV providers pay retransmission fees to station owners to broadcast their content. DirecTV's lawsuit said the defendants deprived it ""of a fair competitive process that has resulted in higher prices being demanded of it and lost profits,"" according to a redacted version of the lawsuit seen by Reuters.
Nexstar spokesperson Gary Weitman said DirecTV's claims were ""without merit"" and the company would fight them in court. He said its agreements with the station groups complied with U.S. Federal Communications Commission guidelines.

A Mission representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for White Knight could not immediately be reached.
Twenty-seven stations owned by Mission and White Knight have been unavailable for DirecTV customers since October 2022 after they failed to agree on retransmission fees. Nexstar is expected to renegotiate its retransmission agreements with DirecTV, which is 70% owned by AT&T, possibly by later this year.
The lawsuit said that by conspiring to set retransmission fees, the station groups forced providers and their customers ""to pay supracompetitive prices or lose access to the most popular broadcast television programming.""
The lawsuit claims that Nexstar, which previously owned Mission and White Knight's stations, still retains the ultimate economic interest in the stations even though they are supposed to be independent.
Michael Hartman, DirecTV's general counsel, said it decided to sue in order to ""bring some transparency"" to what it calls anticompetitive conduct.

The decision by special prosecutor Andrea Reeb came a month after Baldwin's attorney filed a motion to remove her because she is also a representative in the state legislature. The Baldwin team argued it violates the state constitution for a legislator to serve in another branch of government.
Baldwin on Feb. 23 entered a not guilty plea to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.
Two others have been charged. Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed will plead not guilty to involuntary manslaughter, her lawyer has said. Assistant Director Dave Hall has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge.

""I will not allow questions about my serving as a legislator and prosecutor to cloud the real issue at hand.""

Mary Carmack-Altwies, New Mexico's First Judicial District Attorney, did not immediately say who would replace Reeb and declined comment except to say paperwork on Reeb's removal had been filed with the court.
Baldwin's lawyer, Luke Nikas, referred through a spokesperson to his motion to disqualify Reeb under the New Mexico constitution's separation-of-powers provision.
The prosecution initially charged Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed with a firearm enhancement that was later dropped, reducing their possible prison sentence from a minimum of five years to a maximum of 18 months.
Gutierrez-Reed has blamed the shooting on potential sabotage, Baldwin's lack of firearms training, and a failure by Halls and Baldwin to call her onto set for extra firearm checks.

Legal,/legal/visa-mastercard-56-bln-settlement-with-retailers-is-upheld-2023-03-15/,"Visa, MasterCard $5.6 bln settlement with retailers is upheld",Jonathan Stempel,2023-03-15 20:39:00+00:00,,"March 15 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld a $5.6 billion antitrust class-action settlement with more than 12 million retailers that accused Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected claims that a class action should not have been certified because of confusion over who deserved compensation, and that the $523 million of legal fees awarded to the retailers' lawyers was too high.
Among the objectors were a group of gas station operators for oil companies such as Chevron (CVX.N) and Shell (SHEL.L).
The operators and the companies both claimed to have been injured after accepting Visa and MasterCard for gas sales.
Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said that although their dispute may need to be resolved in court, it was ""no reason"" to delay payouts to other class members.
The settlement resolved claims that Visa and MasterCard overcharged retailers on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and barred retailers from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.

Settling retailers would be barred from bringing further claims from within the 15-year class period, and for five more years after the settlement became final, court papers show.
Steve Berman, a lawyer for the objectors, said he looked forward to protecting their interests and those of other franchisees in further litigation.
The settlement had won approval from U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn in Dec. 2019, three-and-a-half years after the appeals court voided a $7.25 billion accord approved by a different judge because it shortchanged some retailers.
While upholding the latest settlement, Jacobs said the outcome was ""so remarkable as to prompt disquiet.""
He said this was in part because the retailers' lawyers had billed for 630,000 hours of work, or about 72 calendar years, and could collect more if Visa and MasterCard's anticompetitive behavior resumed and more litigation ensued.

The jury accepted Constellation's argument that its license to distribute beer bearing Modelo's brand names also allows it to sell alcoholic drinks like Corona Hard Seltzer and Modelo Ranch Water.
A Grupo Modelo spokesperson said the company was disappointed with the verdict and ""evaluating all options.""
A Constellation spokesperson said the company was pleased with the verdict and remains ""committed to continuing to operate in accordance with the terms of our sublicense agreement.""
A Constellation predecessor began distributing Mexico-based Modelo's beers in 1996. Modelo sued Constellation in 2021, alleging its 2020 launch of Corona Hard Seltzer breached their licensing agreement and infringed its trademarks.

Modelo added Modelo Ranch Water to the lawsuit last year after Constellation launched the alcoholic sparkling water drink.
Constellation told the court that the drinks are covered by part of its license that allows it to sell ""other versions"" of beer or malt beverages under the Modelo brand names.
U.S. Circuit Judge Lewis Kaplan determined in December that the contract's definition of the term ""beer"" was too ambiguous to decide the case before trial, even though he said Modelo ""has more dictionaries on its side of this debate.""
Modelo has separately sued Constellation over its tequila- and bourbon-barrel aged Modelo Reserva beers, in a case that is currently in mediation.
Modelo said the tequila-barrel beers break U.S. and Mexican laws governing the use of the word ""tequila"" and that the bourbon-barrel beers violate Constellation's agreement to sell only ""Mexican-style beers"" under the Modelo name.

Lawyers from the state's Civil Rights Department urged Judge Evelio Grillo during a court hearing in Oakland to limit a tentative ruling he issued on Monday requesting more information.
California state judges typically issue tentative rulings ahead of hearings, but can make changes to those rulings when issuing final decisions. Grillo said he would issue a final ruling in the next few days.
California law requires the civil rights department to investigate discrimination complaints by workers before suing employers. If the agency did not adequately probe certain claims against Tesla before suing, the electric carmaker could seek to have them removed from the case.

The agency claims that Tesla's Fremont, California, plant is a racially segregated workplace where Black employees have been harassed and discriminated against in job assignments, discipline and pay. Tesla has denied the allegations and said the lawsuit was politically motivated.
Sirithon Thanasombat, a lawyer for the department, told Grillo on Tuesday that courts only have the power to determine whether an investigation took place and not to inquire into the details or sufficiency of an investigation.
Tesla’s lawyer, Thomas Hill, countered that some level of detail is required to make that determination.
“Our defense with regard to at least some of the claims in this case is that no investigation was conducted at all,” Hill said.
Grillo said he was concerned that not requiring the department to provide any details could violate Tesla’s constitutional right to due process, since the company is entitled to argue that the agency failed to investigate the claims before suing.
But the judge also said that there should be some limit to the information the department must provide.
“You don’t get to inquire into the most minute details,” Grillo said. “But in between that and ‘trust us,’ there’s a big gap.”
Several other lawsuits are pending in California courts that accuse Tesla of tolerating discrimination and sexual harassment at its factories. Tesla has denied wrongdoing.
A federal judge in Oakland in April 2022 cut a jury award to a Black worker who alleged racial harassment from $137 million to $15 million. The worker rejected the reduced award and opted for a new trial on damages, which is scheduled to begin on March 27.

Analysts expect the decision will likely be challenged before the California Supreme Court, which could take months to decide whether to accept the case, and over a year to issue a ruling. For now, though, the ruling means companies like Lyft, DoorDash (DASH.N) and Uber have avoided a substantial hit to their earnings.
Shares of Lyft, which on Monday hit a record low, were up 6%. Uber and DoorDash rose 7% and 6%, respectively.
A three-judge panel of the state appeals court on Monday reversed a lower court ruling in 2021 that the ballot measure, known as Proposition 22, was unconstitutional.
""The ruling clears the path for Uber's continued stock outperformance,"" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said. Jefferies estimated Uber, Lyft and DoorDash would have seen a combined hit of between $20 million and $170 million to their 2024 core earnings.
View 2 more stories 
Prop 22 was approved in November 2020 and exempted app-based drivers from a 2019 state law known as AB5 that makes it difficult to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees.
The companies have been battling with regulators over how they compensate and grant more benefits including insurance and sick leave to their gig workers, who have the flexibility of working for any app they choose to but do not receive the same legal protection as employees.
If Prop22 is repealed, it will be replaced by AB5, which would require the companies to reclassify drivers as employees and provide full benefits and hourly pay rather than just trip time.
The latest ruling could also pave the way for other states to follow, analysts said.
Uber has dominated the rideshare and food delivery space thanks to massive scale, flexibility and presence in multiple global markets, crushing rivals Lyft and DoorDash.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace and others told an Alaska federal court the U.S. Interior Department finalized the Willow approval on Monday without addressing flaws in the plan identified by a federal judge in 2021. They asked the court to vacate the approval, which would block ConocoPhillips from moving forward with the construction.
""Developing a massive new Arctic oil formation is a threat to the global climate and an already dramatically warming Arctic region,"" the suit said.
An Interior spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday. ConocoPhillips did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A separate lawsuit challenging the approval was filed on Tuesday by the Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, Sierra Club, Trustees for Alaska and the Alaska Wilderness League.

Approvals for the project in northern Alaska give ConocoPhillips permission to construct three drill pads, 25.8 miles of gravel roads, an air strip and hundreds of miles of ice roads.
ConocoPhillips had originally sought to drill five oil pads and related infrastructure.
The 30-year project would produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, according to the company. The federal government estimates that it would release over 260 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.
According to the second suit filed Tuesday, the latest approval failed to adequately consider the rise in emissions that would result from consumers burning the oil extracted from the site’s wellpads.
The groups also raised concerns about the threat of oil spills and irreparable damage from construction to the ecologically-sensitive region that is home to subsistence indigenous communities and endangered species like polar bears and seals.

Trustees for Alaska, the Alaska Wilderness League, the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and other groups said the U.S. Interior Department approved Willow on public lands on the north coast of the state despite acknowledging and failing to mitigate ""known harms"" to Arctic communities, public health, wildlife and climate.
The suit claims the administration failed to consider cumulative effects of Willow and essentially ignored elements of its new climate consideration guidelines for reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, despite claiming to incorporate them.
""The Biden administration has failed to listen to the science, the voices of Native leaders in the region and millions of people across America who have pleaded for the protection of air quality, subsistence resources and the global climate by rejecting Willow,"" said Karlin Itchoak, of The Wilderness Society.

The project had been criticized by youth on social media including TikTok and by the United Nations, which has urged countries to speed the transition off fossil fuels.
The Interior Department on Monday approved three drill pads for Willow after saying last month it was concerned about the greenhouse gas emissions. ConocoPhillips had wanted up to five drill sites and infrastructure including dozens of miles of roads and pipelines and seven bridges.
Interior said the smaller size will reduce impacts on species like polar bears and yellow-billed loons.
Earthjustice, an environmental lawfirm, will file an additional lawsuit, the groups said.

President Joe Biden's administration approved a trimmed-down version of the $7 billion Willow project on federal lands in a pristine area on Alaska's north coast. Biden has been trying to balance his goal of decarbonizing the U.S. economy by 2050 as Russia's war in Ukraine raises worries about global energy security.
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has held the leases in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska since 1999. Former President Donald Trump's administration approved the project in 2020. But Alaska District Court Judge Sharon Gleason blocked it a year later arguing its environmental impact analysis was flawed.
Now environmental groups are combing through the Biden Interior Department's approval for flaws that could provide them grounds for new lawsuits.

""We have some serious questions about whether this decision actually complies with the court's order from August 2021,"" said Bridget Psarianos, senior staff attorney at Trustees for Alaska. ""We'll be looking closely at how (Interior's) Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is considering alternatives and what its final approvals are.""
Judge Gleason had ruled that Trump's Interior Department failed to include projections for greenhouse gas emissions from foreign consumption of Willow's oil and also failed to analyze alternatives to the project.
Trustees for Alaska is also analyzing whether the latest approval complied with federal statutes like the National Environmental Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the 1976 Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, Psarianos said.
Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another group involved in the previous suits, said Monday's approval for the Willow project is ""still inadequate in numerous respects.""
The approval would allow Conoco to develop more than 90% of the oil it had originally aimed for despite limiting the number of well pads, and the administration failed to explain how this was consistent with climate change goals, Monsell said.
She said the analysis did not adequately address cumulative impacts of the oil and gas development, including how greenhouse gas emissions from burning the fossil fuels would impact survival of threatened or endangered animals like polar bears and seals.
""That just adds insult to injury for these species that will be directly harmed by the project through oil spills, habitat destruction, and noise pollution,"" Monsell said.
Interior said it had no comment.
Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican from Alaska, told reporters the state's lawmakers are prepared to defend the decision against ""frivolous"" legal challenges.
""We will do so by working closely with the same Alaska stakeholders who brought us this far,"" Sullivan said. ""We are already prepping an amicus brief for any litigation that will come against this decision,"" he said.
Erik Grafe of Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, called litigation ""very likely"" and said it ""does not look like Interior has fixed the myriad legal flaws that Earthjustice and others identified for the agency prior to its decision"".
Jenny Rowland-Shea, the director for public lands at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said another concern was a leak last year of 7.2 million cubic feet of natural gas at ConocoPhillip's nearby Alpine oil field, which forced 300 of the 400 workers there to evacuate. Local regulators are still assessing its causes.
The BLM's environmental impact statement downplayed the risks of such a leak at Willow, but lawyers could make a case that Interior's record of decision did not adequately consider the issue, Rowland said.
Dennis Nuss, a Conoco spokesperson, said the company would not be surprised by another legal challenge but believes U.S. agencies ""have conducted a thorough process that satisfies all legal requirements"".
John Leshy, professor at U.C. College of the Law, San Francisco and a former Interior Department solicitor under former President Bill Clinton, suggested the department did not have much choice in approving the projects. If Interior had not approved Willow then ConocoPhillips would likely have sued the agency saying its lease rights had been taken.
And if the courts side with environmental groups on potential lawsuits it would probably only delay Willow, Leshy said.
But Mark Squillace, a professor at the University of Colorado Law School and former Interior Department lawyer said there were other threats to the project, including potential declining prices for oil as electric vehicles drive the energy transition which could threaten Willow's long-term viability.
""The bigger risk to the project is economic,"" he said.

The justices took up an appeal by the parents and other relatives of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-year-old woman from California who was studying in Paris, of a lower court's ruling that cleared Google LLC-owned YouTube of wrongdoing in a lawsuit seeking monetary damages that the family brought under a U.S. anti-terrorism law. Google and YouTube are part of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O).
The Supreme Court also agreed to hear a separate appeal by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) of the lower court's decision to revive a similar lawsuit against that company, though not on the basis of Section 230.
The lawsuit against Google accused it of materially supporting terrorism in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act, a federal law that allows Americans to recover damages related to ""an act of international terrorism."" The lawsuit alleged that YouTube, through computer algorithms, recommended videos by the Islamic State militant group, which claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, to certain users.
View 2 more stories 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2021 dismissed the lawsuit in a ruling relying largely on another law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.
Section 230, enacted before the rise of today's major social media companies, protects ""interactive computer services"" by ensuring they cannot be treated as the ""publisher or speaker"" of any information provided by other users.
The lawsuit argued that such immunity should not apply when the company's platform recommends certain content via algorithms that identify and display content most likely to interest users, based on how people use the service.
Section 230 has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum. Democrats have faulted it for giving social media companies a pass for spreading hate speech and misinformation. Republicans painted it as a tool for censorship of voices on the right, especially after Twitter and other platforms banned then-President Donald Trump from after a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in a deadly riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump as president unsuccessfully sought its repeal.
Gonzalez was among 130 people killed in Paris during the 2015 attacks that included suicide bombings and mass shootings. She was at a bistro called La Belle Equipe when militants fired on the crowd of diners.
The plaintiffs said that YouTube's algorithm helped Islamic State spread its militant message by recommending to users the group's videos including those aimed at recruiting jihadist fighters, and that the company's ""assistance"" was a cause of the 2015 attacks.
Gonzalez's family appealed the 9th Circuit ruling to the Supreme Court, noting that while algorithms may suggest benign dance videos to some, ""other recommendations suggest that users look at materials inciting dangerous, criminal or self-destructive behavior.""
The family added that removing Section 230 protections would prompt websites to stop recommending harmful materials, while saying that allowing the immunity ""denies redress to victims who could have shown that those recommendations had caused their injuries, or the deaths of their loved ones.""
In the case against Twitter, American family members of Nawras Alassaf, a Jordanian citizen who died in a nightclub mass shooting in 2017 in Istanbul also claimed by Islamic State, accused that social media company of violating the anti-terrorism law by failing to police the platform for Islamic State accounts or posts.
The 9th Circuit in the same ruling reversed a federal judge's decision to throw out the case against Twitter, but did not assess Twitter's claim of immunity under Section 230.

In a brief filed late on Tuesday with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, lawyers for Musk called the pre-approval mandate a ""government-imposed muzzle"" that inhibited and chilled his lawful speech on a broad range of topics.
They also said the requirement violated the U.S. Constitution, and undermined public policy by running ""contrary to the American principles of free speech and open debate.""
The SEC declined to comment on Wednesday. It is expected to file its own brief with the appeals court.
Musk wants to overturn part of an April 27 decision by U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman that rejected his bid to throw out the consent decree altogether.

Liman said Musk's arguments amounted to a ""bemoaning"" of requirements he no longer wanted to adhere to now that ""his company has become, in his estimation, all but invincible.""
Musk, 51, is worth $259.8 billion, nearly twice as much as anyone else, Forbes magazine said on Wednesday.
The decree resolved a lawsuit accusing Musk of defrauding investors with a Aug. 7, 2018 tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take his electric car company private, though a buyout was not close. Musk has said the tweet was truthful.
In settling, Musk agreed to let a Tesla lawyer screen tweets that might contain material information about the company.
He and Tesla each also paid $20 million in civil fines, and Musk gave up his role as Tesla chairman.
But the SEC later opened a probe and subpoenaed documents concerning Musk's and Tesla's compliance, after Musk asked his followers in a Nov. 6, 2021 tweet whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake to cover tax bills on stock options.
In Tuesday's filing, Musk's lawyers said it was time to rein in the SEC, which is keeping him under ""constant threat"" it might reject his view of which disclosures require pre-approval.
""Under the shadow of the consent decree, the SEC has increasingly surveilled, policed, and attempted to curb Mr. Musk’s protected speech that does not touch upon the federal securities laws,"" the lawyers wrote. ""Any objective served by the pre-approval provision has been served.""
Musk is separately trying to abandon his April agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion, saying the company misled him by downplaying the number of fake accounts.  read more

U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk during a hearing in Amarillo also pressed the groups, led by the Texas-based Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, to explain how he could reverse approval of a long-established drug.
The judge raised the possibility of a more limited ruling, keeping the drug on the market but re-imposing some restrictions lifted by Biden's administration, including requiring it to be dispensed in person rather than by mail. Kacsmaryk, appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump, said he would rule ""as soon as possible.""
It is shaping up as the most consequential abortion case since the U.S. Supreme Court, powered by its conservative majority, last year overturned its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had recognized a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.
View 2 more stories 
The anti-abortion groups sued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November, contending the agency used an improper process when it approved mifepristone in 2000 and did not adequately consider the drug's safety when used by girls under age 18.
The plaintiffs are asking Kacsmaryk for a preliminary order halting sales of mifepristone nationwide - even in states where abortion is legal - while their lawsuit proceeds.
Twelve of the 50 states now ban abortion outright while many others prohibit it after a certain length of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. A ruling against the FDA would hinder abortion access in every state as medication abortion - with mifepristone part of a two-pill regimen - accounts for more than half of U.S. abortions.
The judge heard arguments in a windowless courtroom in a small courthouse in the northwest corner of Texas for more than four hours, listening intently and asking questions.
Erik Baptist, a lawyer with the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom representing the plaintiffs, said the scope of the judge's ruling should be ""universal and nationwide.""
The judge questioned lawyers for Biden's administration on how the FDA accelerated its approval for mifepristone under a process typically used for drugs to treat HIV infection and other life-threatening illnesses. The administration has said that the drug's approval was well supported by science, and that the challenge comes much too late.

Lawyers for the U.S. Justice Department and an attorney for mifepristone's manufacturer, Danco Laboratories, argued that the plaintiffs had no standing to bring the case, and said mifepristone has an impressive safety and efficacy record.
""An injunction here would upend the status quo. An injunction would cause significant public harm,"" Justice Department attorney Julie Straus Harris told the judge.
Harris also argued that a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would undercut trust in the FDA, the agency charged with signing off on the safety of food products and drugs in the United States. Harris said such a ruling would also increase the burden on surgical abortion clinics, already overcrowded as they admit patients from states where clinics have closed in the wake of last year's Supreme Court decision.
Mifepristone is available under the brand name Mifeprex and as a generic. Used in conjunction with another drug called misoprostol, it is approved to terminate a pregnancy within the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy. The FDA in January said that the government for the first time will allow mifepristone to be dispensed at retail pharmacies.
Major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have weighed in on the side of the FDA, saying mifepristone ""has been thoroughly studied and is conclusively safe.""
Abortion rights supporters, contending that the lawsuit is a baseless attempt to slash abortion access, protested outside the courthouse on Wednesday morning. One dressed as a kangaroo and carried a gavel, suggesting that the hearing was a ""kangaroo court.""
By suing in Amarillo, where the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine had been incorporated just three months earlier, the plaintiffs ensured that the case would go before Kacsmaryk, a conservative former Christian activist.

In a complaint filed in Cleveland federal court, the Department of Justice said Rite Aid repeatedly filled prescriptions from May 2014 to June 2019 that were medically unnecessary, for off-label use, or not issued in the usual course of professional practice.
""The Justice Department is using every tool at our disposal to confront the opioid epidemic that is killing Americans and shattering communities across the country,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
Rite Aid pharmacists were accused of ignoring obvious signs of misuse, including in prescriptions for ""trinities,"" a combination of opioids, benzodiazepine, and muscle relaxants preferred by drug abusers for their increased euphoric effect.

The Justice Department also said Rite Aid intentionally deleted some pharmacists' internal warnings about suspicious prescribers, such as ""cash only pill mill???"", while admonishing them to ""be mindful of everything that is put in writing.""
""These practices opened the floodgates for millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Rite Aid's stores,"" Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said.
Rite Aid is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains, with more than 2,330 stores in 17 U.S. states. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Justice Department accused Rite Aid of violating the federal False Claims Act by submitting false prescription claims to government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
It joined a whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2019 by two pharmacists and a pharmacy technician from Rite Aid stores in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and West Virginia.
The Justice Department occasionally joins whistleblower cases it considers stronger.
It has also sued Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N) over their alleged roles in the nation's opioid crisis.
More than 500,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States from 1999 to 2020, including more than 90,000 in 2020 alone, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

A final deal is subject to meeting certain conditions including obtaining ""regulatory approvals from relevant government authorities and all stakeholders related to the acquisition"", Hyundai said in a statement.
GM stopped selling cars in India in 2017 after years of dwindling sales but its complete exit from the market has been marred by complications, including legal tussles with workers and the failure to find a buyer for the plant which is in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.
In 2019, GM agreed to sell the plant to China's Great Wall Motor (601633.SS) but talks collapsed last year after the companies failed to obtain regulatory approvals amid New Delhi's increased scrutiny of investments from Beijing.

GM and its factory workers - who allege illegal termination after the company decided to exit - have also been locked in legal battles since 2021. In the latest setback, in January, a union sued GM's India unit and its global CEO for failing to pay court-ordered compensation to sacked factory workers.
GM has previously said its employees have been legally separated and it remains confident of its legal position.
India has been a tough battleground for Western carmakers, especially U.S. companies, that have struggled to break the dominance of Japan's Suzuki Motor (7269.T) and South Korea's Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), which together hold 60% market share. Like GM, Ford Motor (F.N), too, ceased operations in India.
This acquisition will give Hyundai a second plant in India allowing the carmaker to boost production capacity at a time when it plans to launch six electric vehicles in India by 2028.

The term 'greenwashing' describes exaggerated and misleading claims that suggest an entity are stewards of the environment without real action.
Market Forces said in a new report AustralianSuper, Commonwealth Super Corp, Australian Retirement Trust, Aware Super and AMP, which cumulatively manage more than A$1 trillion ($668 billion) in savings, had failed to ""demonstrate effective engagement strategies"".

ESG Investors,/business/sustainable-business/,Credit Suisse sets more 2030 targets for emissions tied to loans,Reuters,2023-03-14 15:30:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FRQL54TQMVL4PJTI25UMCDFAIM.jpg,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse on Tuesday announced targets for cutting emissions tied to loans it makes to six sectors as well as restrictions on lending to the dirtiest fossil fuel projects, although climate activists said the announcements fell short of what was needed.
The Swiss bank (CSGN.S) set emissions reductions targets for 2030 for the power generation, commercial real estate, iron and steel, aluminium, and automotive sectors, with emissions intensity reduction goals ranging 31%-64%.
Credit Suisse already has a pledge in place to cut absolute emissions tied to loans to the oil, gas and coal sector of 49% by 2030, and on Tuesday said emissions from loans to those clients had fallen 64% by end-2022, although the numbers can fluctuate year to year.
The bank also announced some restrictions on lending to companies involved in Arctic oil and gas, oil sands and deep sea mining.
Banks globally are unveiling targets for how they intend to align their businesses with the Paris climate agreement and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Environmental groups have welcomed banks' increased disclosure but accuse many lenders of lacking ambition and failing to cut their support for fossil fuels fast enough if the world is to limit global temperature rises to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Responsible investment advocacy group ShareAction called on investors to vote against Credit Suisse's climate strategy, which will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at its annual general meeting.
""Credit Suisse's new climate strategy is not fit for purpose – it ignores two of the most crucial areas of fossil fuel financing that would have enabled the bank to reach net zero by 2050,"" Kelly Shields, ShareAction's Campaign and Project Manager, said in a statement, referring to the bank's oil and gas policy and the omission of capital markets activities.
Some banks have omitted emissions linked to underwriting of shares and bonds - so-called facilitated emissions - from their targets until there is an agreed industry methodology to measure them.

ESG Investors,/business/sustainable-business/,"As wages go up, Japanese women reckon with a vast pay gap",David Dolan,2023-03-15 23:50:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ODC3RULX7BPQRETBAGSQARCWIQ.jpg,"TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - As Japanese companies offer their heftiest wage raises in decades, women in the world's third-largest economy are hoping it won't take as long to close the vast gap in pay with men.
Wages have hardly budged since the late 1990s due to years of deflation and stop-start growth. But it's even tougher for women, who make around 78% of what men earn.
That gender wage gap is the worst among the Group of Seven nations and almost double the OECD average.
Much of the problem, experts and government officials say, is the lack of career advancement.
When Kasumi Mizoguchi joined a top trading firm out of university in 2015, she was dismayed by the gender disparity in a rigid human resources system that classified employees as either ""career track"" or ""non-career track"". Non-career workers, who were all women, did the administrative work.
While Mizoguchi was hired on the career track, she left after two years, frustrated, and now works at an advertising and design firm in London.

""Hierarchy was one of the bigger reasons that I left -- just feeling that you don't matter, that you don't have a say,"" she said.
Only 9.4% of managers are women, according to research firm Teikoku Databank, despite women accounting for around a third of full-time workers. The government wants to increase the ratio of women managers to around 30% by 2030, a decade later than it previously targeted.
The percentage of women in senior executive roles is higher, at 13%.
There are signs of improvement. Under disclosure rules introduced last year, bigger companies are required to report their wage gap annually. From this year they will have to disclose more information in regulatory filings, and in some cases disclose the ratio of women in management positions.
The government makes the information available online, allowing job seekers to scrutinise potential employers.
""The fact that companies have to disclose puts pressure on them,"" said Akiko Kojima, a specialist at The Japan Research Institute. ""It is meaningful, but it is not enough. If companies just disclose the data but don't increase the number of women managers, the gap won't narrow.""
The issue is critical for Japan's economy, experts say, to help address a chronic labour crunch as the population shrinks.
While women's labour force participation has increased in recent years following the ""Womenomics"" reforms of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, more than half of all women work at non-permanent jobs, according to government data. Those positions tend to have fewer benefits, lower pay and shorter hours.
When women leave the workforce to have children, they often return to a lower-paying position, or a part-time job.
Chika Sasaki, a manager at a Tokyo-based wholesaler, said there were too few women in leadership positions at her office, and too few working mothers like herself.
""Almost all of the people in senior management are men. That's why I think there's a difference in salaries between men and women,"" Sasaki said, declining to name her employer.
""I don't think they care about it too much. I'm a manager but I don't have anyone who is a role model.""
Brokerage Daiwa Securities Group Inc (8601.T) in 2005 started a programme to help female employees after its then president realised too many talented women were struggling to balance their careers and families.
It extended maternity leave to three years and took measures to promote re-hiring women.
In 2009, four women were among the 13 employees promoted to senior managing director that year, one of whom has since joined the board.
The firm made a deliberate decision to promote several women at once so they could work together if they received pushback from male colleagues, according to Chiharu Mori, director of Daiwa's diversity and inclusion promotion office.
""We are trying to address all kinds of gender gaps, not just about pay, but everything,"" Mori said.
Daiwa encourages employees to leave the office before 7 p.m. and has made paternity leave mandatory, rare measures in Japan.
So far it has been difficult for ESG investors - who are increasingly concerned with the gender gap - to engage with many Japanese companies on the issue, said Tomohiko Sano, head of Japan ESG research at JPMorgan Securities.
Those that do disclose tend to already be high performing companies, he said.
""It's hard for investors to convince companies about the benefits of these efforts,"" he said.

Sustainable Markets,/business/autos-transportation/,Group of EU countries discuss weakening limits on car emissions,Robert Muller,2023-03-13 20:21:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/D7IERA5C5NOVPLFPRRS6CXYX2U.jpg,"PRAGUE/BRUSSELS, March 13 (Reuters) - Transport ministers from the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia on Monday discussed their push to change proposed European Union vehicle emissions limits.
The proposed Euro 7 law, which EU countries and lawmakers will start negotiating this year, would tighten limits on health-harming pollutants, including nitrogen oxides. The EU has said the health benefits would far outweigh the costs.
But countries, including the Czech Republic, oppose the proposed rules which they say are burdensome for industry. Most have big car-making sectors.
An EU official said the ministers had discussed the law's ""unrealistic"" deadlines and issues with equipment to enforce it.
""Our effort is, in the area of Euro 7, to make those conditions really realistic, to make them achievable,"" Czech Transport Minister Martin Kupka said in a telephone interview following the meeting in Strasbourg, which he convened.
View 2 more stories 
The Czech Republic said the countries had reservations on the short period for adoption of the norm, which under proposals should come into force in mid-2025 for cars.
It has proposed a four-year period for the norm to take effect, along with some technical changes, to give industry time to prepare and boost technological measures.
""If we are really serious about trying to bring Europe to greater carbon neutrality, I think that really means bringing in technologically realistic measures,"" Kupka said.
The countries also discussed a separate row over the bloc's 2035 deadline to phase out CO2 emitting cars, which would effectively make it impossible to sell new combustion engine cars after 2035.
The CO2 law, the EU's main tool to speed up Europe's shift to electric vehicles, was put on hold this month after last-minute opposition from Germany. That surprised policymakers in Brussels and other member states, since EU countries and the European Parliament had already agreed a deal on the law last year.
Germany, backed by countries including Italy and the Czech Republic, wants clearer assurances that new cars with internal combustion engines can still be sold after 2035, if they run on CO2-neutral fuels.
Other countries have different reservations. Poland, for example, has said its opposition is ""much more fundamental"" than the types of fuels that can be used after 2035, and has said the proposal would make combustion engines more expensive for consumers.
The EU says the 2035 date is crucial because the average lifespan of new cars is 15 years – so a later ban would stop the EU reaching net zero emissions by 2050, the global milestone scientists say would avert disastrous climate change. Transport accounts for around a quarter of EU emissions.
Parts of Europe's car industry are also lobbying to weaken the EU law. Porsche (PSHG_p.DE) CEO Oliver Blume said on Monday in his view Berlin was ""taking the appropriate steps"" to ensure e-fuels can be used in new combustion engine cars after 2035.

Sustainable Markets,/business/sustainable-business/,Study sees potential for huge North Sea hydrogen pipelines,Vera Eckert,2023-03-16 12:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7HZVTUDH3VL3PAAYH3GSQHGGF4.jpg,"FRANKFURT, March 16 (Reuters) - Investments of between 15 and 22 billion euros ($15.92-$23.36 billion) could buy a 4,200-kilometre new hydrogen pipeline network linking Germany, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, according to a study from analysts at DNV consultancy on Thursday.
The study, commissioned by German gas pipeline operator Gascade, says that up to 300 terawatt hours (TWh) a year of clean hydrogen made from North Sea offshore wind power could be transported by the grid.
This would meet 15% of demand for the synthetic fuel that the European Union forecasts for the year 2050.
Germany and the European Union are seeking to shift future energy production towards renewables and to produce, import and market hydrogen from wind and sunshine to eliminate climate-warming gases.
""We believe it is important to look now to be able to arrive at an offshore European hydrogen grid in time,"" said Ulrich Benterbusch, managing director of Gascade, which is jointly owned by oil and gas producer Wintershall Dea (WINT.UL) and gas importer Securing Energy for Europe (Sefe).

Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark last year pledged to build at least 150 gigawatts of offshore wind in the North Sea by 2050. The EU had 15 GW of offshore wind capacity in 2021.
The four signatories to the so-called Esbjerg declaration will meet again in Belgium in April.
DNV asked whether offshore wind power should be converted on-site into hydrogen via electrolysis plants, or whether the power should be brought to coastal electrolysis facilities.
The coastal option was most price-efficient for wind power produced less than 100 kilometres away from land.
On-site hydrogen production out at sea would save on costly new electricity cables of far lower energy capacity, when compared with pipelines, and would beat costs of seaborne hydrogen imports from overseas.
The cost of North Sea hydrogen could be 4.59 euros per kg in 2030, falling to 3.24 euros/kg in 2050, said the authors.

Regulatory Oversight,/business/sustainable-business/,Bank of England to study climate-related capital further,Huw Jones,2023-03-13 14:20:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/U6T3WWAQ6FPIVCQVMAEPAJ325Y.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will carry out further study as it is not yet clear whether it needs to require banks and insurers to set aside longer-term capital buffers to provide for the consequences of climate change, it said on Monday.
The Bank was setting out its latest thinking on how climate change will impact the financial firms it regulates.
It may, for example, cause more flooding to destroy property financed by banks and insured by insurers.
Existing capital rules capture some of the longer-term fallout, but may be incomplete due to difficulties estimating risks from climate change, the BoE said.
""Existing capability and regime gaps create uncertainty over whether banks and insurers are sufficiently capitalised for future climate-related losses,"" the BoE said in a statement.
The short-term priority is for firms to get better at plugging the data gaps that prevent reliable estimates of how much capital is needed for a bank to withstand shocks.
View 2 more stories 
The Bank said that existing time horizons over which risks are capitalised, usually covering a few years into the future, are appropriate for now given there is not yet sufficient justification for policy changes.
""The Bank will continue to explore how climate risks can be calibrated within the timelines embedded in existing capital frameworks,"" it said.
The BoE said it would also look at whether ""macroprudential,"" or sector-wide buffers, could be needed, though this would be challenging.
""A macroprudential response may be justified by the fact that climate change creates foreseeable risks at the system level, but these risks are largely unquantifiable and the Bank is unable to identify which firms they will impact,"" it said.
""These issues would benefit from further research to inform ongoing policy work.""
Global banking regulators are also looking at whether bespoke capital buffers are needed for climate risks.

“There are those who continue to think we would adjust the agreement ... I say they need to wait until Friday Dec 29 2023 to demonstrate to them our commitment to the current agreement.”
Prince Abdulaziz also said the U.S. Senate's proposed NOPEC bill was a different concept from price caps that have been imposed by Western countries on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine, yet they had similar potential impacts on the oil market.
Last week, U.S. senators from both political parties reintroduced the so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels, or NOPEC, bill. If passed it would change U.S. antitrust law to revoke the sovereign immunity that has protected members of the OPEC+ alliance and their national oil companies from lawsuits over price collusion.
There have been several attempts to pass the NOPEC bill over more than two decades.
View 2 more stories 
""The NOPEC bill does not recognize the importance of holding spare capacity and the consequences of not holding spare capacity on market stability,” he said.
The NOPEC bill would undermine investments in oil capacity and cause global supply to fall, he said and any price caps would have a similar effect.
The prince said price caps whether imposed on a country or a group of countries would lead to ""individual or collective counter-responses with intolerable consequences in the form of massive volatility and instability.""
“If a price cap were to be imposed on Saudi oil exports, we will not sell oil to any country that imposes a price cap on our supply and we will reduce oil production and I would not be surprised if others do the same.""
The Group of Seven Countries, the European Union and Australia implemented the price cap on seaborne cargoes of Russian oil on Dec. 5, setting it at $60 a barrel. Russia has said it would cut 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of supply from March.
Prince Abdulaziz also said global demand growth would outpace current global spare capacity while emergency reserves were at a historic low. ""That is why it is crucial that policies are put in place to support investments needed to increase spare capacity in a timely manner and that global emergency stocks are maintained at an adequate and comfortable level.""
Despite forecasts for global economic growth, the prince said uncertainty remained on the demand recovery outlook as China opens up after strict zero Covid policies. Another wild card was how aggressively central banks would hike rates to tame inflation, he said.

Snam booked an impairment of 340 million euros ($360.50 million) on its 85% stake in TAG, which transports gas through the Austrian segment of the pipeline linking Russia to Italy.
""TAG faces higher volatility in its 2023 results owing to the uncertainty of gas flows from the north towards Italy, which are expected to decrease compared to historical levels, although this will be partly offset by higher booked volumes of gas flowing from Italy to Austria,"" the gas grid operator said.
Adjusted net profit was 1.16 billion euros ($1.23 billion) in 2022, down 4.5% versus 2021 but higher than Snam's guidance of 1.13 billion euros.

Gas markets were thrown into turmoil last year by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Europe is seeking alternatives to Russian supplies on which countries such as Italy depended for decades.
Snam's investments rose by more than 50% last year to 1.93 billion euros as it bought two terminals for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
The LNG infrastructure in Piombino, Tuscany, will be operational in May, Snam CEO Stefano Venier told a conference call.
As gas prices surged to record levels in Europe and consumers sought to limit consumption, gas demand in Italy fell 10% last year to 68.7 billion cubic metres (bcm). It is expected to be around 68-70 bcm this year.
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Wednesday it was considering selling its majority stake in Italy's main regasification terminal in the Adriatic Sea.
Snam, which owns a 7.3% stake in the terminal, may consider ""rounding up our stake,"" if the sale goes ahead, Venier said.
In a shift from what the group suggested in January, Venier clarified that Snam did not plan to sell its 13% stake in gas distributor Italgas (IG.MI).

The total investment is 17% higher than in a previous 10-year plan, Terna said in a statement.
An innovative 'hypergrid' project is the main new feature introduced in the new plan, with investments of 11 billion euros in five new electricity 'backbones' that will double the power exchange capacity from the south to the north to 30 gigawatts.
The hypergrid, to be completed in the next 15 years, will allow Italy to make renewable energy available across the whole country.
""Renewable energy sources represent our oil. Enabling their deployment and integration is part of our mission as directors of the electricity system and will be decisive for our country's energy security,"" Terna CEO Stefano Donnarumma said.

Water Management,/business/energy/,"Philippine firm planning IPO targets new gas wells, solar investment",Neil Jerome Morales,2023-03-15 08:19:00+00:00,,"MANILA, March 15 (Reuters) - Philippine holding firm Prime Infrastructure Capital Inc aims to put new wells at the country's only major natural gas project into commercial operation in 2026, and is seeking other fields to ensure long-term output, its CEO told Reuters on Wednesday.
Prime Infrastructure has also lined up other energy projects including an investment of at least 200 billion pesos ($3.7 billion) in solar power and battery energy storage systems ahead of its planned initial public offering (IPO) this year.
""The first step is to continue extracting as much gas as possible from the existing source. To that end, we will be drilling new wells,"" Prime Infrastructure Chief Executive Guillaume Lucci said in an interview.
It is also looking for additional gas fields within its existing Malampaya concession and other areas, Lucci said.
The Malampaya gas project, located offshore Palawan province, started commercial operations in 2001, supplying power plants that deliver about a fifth of the country's electricity requirements.

Prime Infrastructure is seeking a 15-year extension of the project contract, which is set to expire in 2024, and is exploring for more gas with output expected to run dry by 2027.
The holding firm owned by ports and gaming tycoon Enrique Razon plans to go public this year, after postponing a planned IPO aiming to raise up to 28 billion pesos ($511 million) last October because of market volatility.
The Philippines' broader stock market index (.PSI) is down 1.5% so far this year, though still outperforming some regional peers.
The company has interests that span energy, water distribution and waste management.
""We certainly need the capital to support our projects but IPO is only one of many ways to raise capital,"" Lucci said.
Prime Infrastructure's unit, Terra Renewables, plans to build the world's largest solar power facility with a capacity of 2,500-3,500 megawatts combined with a battery energy storage system.

Attorney General Letitia James said the fourth-largest cryptocurrency platform violated the Martin Act, a powerful state securities law, by transacting in cryptocurrencies, selling the product ""KuCoin Earn"" to generate income for itself and investors, and wrongfully calling itself an ""exchange.""
In papers filed with a state court in Manhattan, James is seeking a permanent injunction to stop KuCoin from operating in New York until it complies with the law.
KuCoin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Launched in September 2017, KuCoin describes itself on its website as the ""People's Exchange,"" with more than 27 million users across 207 countries and regions.
KuCoin trails Binance, Coinbase and Kraken in trading volume among cryptocurrency spot exchanges, according to the data company CoinMarketCap. It raised $150 million in a funding round last May, giving it a $10 billion valuation.

""One by one my office is taking action against cryptocurrency companies that are brazenly disregarding our laws and putting investors at risk,"" James said in a statement.
Last month, James sued the CoinEx cryptocurrency platform for failing to register with the state.
In January, 10 states including New York secured up to $24 million from the cryptocurrency company Nexo Inc, which they also accused of operating illegally.

Speaking at the Reuters IMPACT climate conference in London, Ibrahim, who made his fortune in African telecommunications, criticized those in the global north for dictating how African countries should use their vast natural gas reserves amid climate change concerns. Some 600 million Africans, about 43% of the continent's population, are without power, he said.
Speaking last month on the sidelines of an African environment ministers' conference in Dakar, Senegal, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry cautioned against investing in long-term gas projects in Africa. Kerry's comments echoed similar remarks issued in a report last year by the International Energy Agency (IEA), saying such moves could jeopardize the global net-zero goal of 2050.
Meanwhile, energy firms have been considering $100 billion in new energy investments on the continent, according to Reuters calculations based on public and private company estimates.

""Now, because of the war, they are running to Africa and saying 'Oh, can we have more gas?',"" Ibrahim said. ""We are not allowed to use our gas. But half our gas is sent to Europe.""
""This kind of stupidity cannot continue,"" he said.
African countries that currently have little or no oil and gas output could see billions in energy investments in the coming years, including Namibia, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania.
The IEA estimates that Africa's gas reserves could potentially replace up to one-fifth of Russian supplies to Europe by 2030.
""But for us to use our own gas? No, no no,"" Ibrahim said.

Britain has a target to install up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2030, up from almost 13 GW currently, as part of its efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
It is also looking at ways of changing its electricity markets to better reflect the costs associated with generating power.  read more

Phillips-Davies said SSE remained committed to investing up to 25 billion pounds ($28 billion) in British energy infrastructure this decade, including in new wind and hydro electric power projects.
Increasing clean energy technology is vital, Phillips-Davies said, to help the country wean itself off costly fossil fuels such as gas, which has soared to record high prices this year driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“The crisis we have got at the moment is a gas crisis and every time we put up another wind turbine we can reduce our reliance on that,” he said.

Clean Energy,/business/energy/,Energy crisis seen posing 'existential threat' to climate goals,Reuters,2022-10-03 17:45:00+00:00,,"LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Europe's energy crisis has upended the green transition and undermined efforts keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, business leaders and environmentalists said on Monday, with one warning of an ""existential threat"" to climate goals.
With parts of Europe facing a possible fuel shortage this winter, panelists at the Reuters IMPACT sustainability conference in London addressed the challenge of keeping the power on - sometimes by producing and using more coal - without giving up on the region's climate goals.
""We're in a transformational moment,"" said Steve Malkin, CEO of environmental consultancy Planet Mark, noting the war in Ukraine and resulting energy crisis posed an ""existential threat"" to countries' sustainability goals.
Prices for thermal coal, used to generate electricity, and other fossil fuels have soared, as many European countries go with less Russian gas.
While coal demand had been expected to decline in the long-term, there's been a resurgence in Europe in recent months as coal plants are turned back on.

""We need (coal) in the short term of the energy crisis,"" said Christian Rynning-Tønnesen, CEO of Europe's largest generator of renewable energy, Statkraft. ""But policywise, we need to go for low emissions and renewables in the long-term.""
While many speakers at the conference worried the energy crisis could slow climate progress in the near term, some were optimistic it could consolidate the movement to greener grids to ensure energy security in the future.
""The transition to renewable energy will go faster now,"" said Ikea CEO Jesper Brodin during an interview with Reuters, noting the crisis would also encourage energy efficiency.
With the next two years expected to be economically challenging, he said, Ikea is introducing more energy efficient products for customers feeling the cost-of-living crunch, including LED lighting and electronics powered by solar light and batteries.

Speaking on a panel at the Reuters IMPACT sustainability conference in central London, Jonathan Maxwell said U.S. electricity challenges showed a need to ""focus on decentralisation"".
""Let's generate (electricity) locally or on site so we don't waste energy somewhere between conversion and transmission, distribution and end use,"" Maxwell said, answering a question from Arctic Basecamp founder Gail Whiteman about lessons learned in the green transition.
Responding to an earlier call by London Mayor Sadiq Khan for 75 billion pounds ($84 billion) in investment to meet the city's net zero goals, Maxwell said that improving energy efficiency could achieve this at a much lower cost.
With Europe facing an energy crisis this year, others speaking on the panel titled ""Moving Beyond Net Zero"" said the recent uptick in coal production should not encourage a fossil fuel revival.

Governance,/business/energy/,"Buying Uniper was 'a mistake', Finnish finance minister says",Anne Kauranen,2022-09-28 09:42:00+00:00,,"HELSINKI, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Buying Germany's top gas importer Uniper (UN01.DE) was ""a mistake"", Finland's finance minister Annika Saarikko told Reuters, after its nationalisation left both countries with huge losses.
Germany agreed to step in to nationalise Uniper, its largest importer of Russian gas, amid a deepening energy crisis that had brought Uniper to its knees. Part of that deal was to buy out Fortum (FORTUM.HE), majority-owned by Finland's government.
Fortum had invested some 7 billion euros ($6.72 billion) in the German company and said it made a loss of nearly 6 billion euros from the exit, one of the biggest business failures in Finnish history.
""Uniper's business and the fossil energy, it wasn't a good idea for Fortum to buy that business a few years ago,"" Saarikko said in an interview recorded for Reuters IMPACT, a climate-focused conference taking place in London on Oct. 3-4.
View 2 more stories 
""Of course we can say now that it was a mistake,"" she added.
Between 2013 and 2015, Fortum had gained some 9 billion euros from selling off its Nordic power transmission business and in 2017, against its previous strategy of investing in emission-free Nordic energy, it decided to invest the money into Uniper, acquiring first a 47% stake from German E.ON.
Subsequently, Fortum raised its stake to around 80% of the German company.
""Is it wise now to look back and search for the guilty?"" Saarikko said, adding ""now we have to look forward"".
In order to solve the energy crisis, the European Union needs to change the pricing structure in the energy markets, Saarikko said.
""To me it is clear that we must decouple the price of natural gas and other energy prices so that the gas price does not drive electricity prices. That's the main problem to solve,"" she said.
The European Commission has proposed emergency energy measures, including bloc-wide windfall profit levies on energy firms, which EU countries are expected to decide on at a meeting of EU ministers on Sept.30.
Finland is open to the Commission's proposals but needs to hear more about them, Saarikko said.

Amazon's satellite internet unit, Project Kuiper, will begin mass-producing the satellites later this year, the company said. Those will be the first of over 3,000 satellites the technology giant plans to launch in low-Earth orbit in the next few years.
""We'll definitely be beta testing with commercial customers in 2024,"" Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon devices, said at a conference in Washington.
The 2024 deployment target would keep Amazon on track to fulfill a regulatory mandate to launch half its entire Kuiper network of 3,236 satellites by 2026. Limp, who oversees Amazon's consumer devices powerhouse, said the company plans to make ""three to five"" satellites a day to reach that goal.

With plans to pump more than $10 billion into the Kuiper network, Amazon sees its experience producing millions of devices from its consumer electronics powerhouse as an edge over rival SpaceX, the Musk-owned space company whose Starlink network already has roughly 4,000 satellites in space.
Amazon plans to launch a pair of prototype satellites early this year aboard a new rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance. The 2024 launch, carrying the initial production satellites, is expected to be the first of many more in a swift deployment campaign using rockets Amazon procured in 2021 and 2022.
The company on Tuesday also revealed a slate of three different terminals, or antennas, that will connect customers with its Kuiper satellites in orbit.
The ""standard customer terminal,"" 11-inch square antennas, will cost the company less than $400 each to produce and provide internet speeds of 400 megabits per second for customers, Amazon said in a statement.
SpaceX's consumer Starlink terminals, priced at $599 each, as well as other bespoke terminals for governments and businesses, are being used by ""more than a million customers to date,"" Jonathan Hofeller, SpaceX's head of Starlink enterprise sales, said Monday.
A smaller, square-shaped mobile antenna, measuring 7 inches wide and weighing one pound, will be Amazon's ""most affordable"" terminal for the network, though the company did not disclose the price.
Amazon's largest, ""most capable"" antenna model, ""designed for enterprise, government and telecommunications applications,"" will be 19 by 30 inches in size and put out internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second - fast enough to download a high-definition feature-length movie in roughly 30 seconds.

The deals were signed on Friday, Energy Minister Davis Chirchir told a news conference, after the two firms were picked from seven bidders.
Foreign currency traders have cast doubt on the ability of the plan to stem the pressure on the shilling currency, saying it merely amounts to a postponement of demand.

At 0625 GMT, the rand traded at 18.2000 against the dollar , more than 0.1% firmer than its closing level on Monday.
Statistics South Africa will publish January mining output (ZAMNG=ECI) around 0930 GMT, and January factory production (ZAMAN=ECI) is due at 1100 GMT.
Economists polled by Reuters are predicting a 2.65% contraction in annual terms in mining, and a 5.1% fall in manufacturing. That compares to a 3.5% contraction in mining in December and a 4.7% fall in manufacturing in December.
The rand rallied on Monday as the dollar fell sharply on expectations that the largest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis would prompt the Federal Reserve to slow the pace of its interest rate hikes.
On Tuesday, the dollar still languished near a multi-week low.
South Africa's benchmark 2030 government bond was also slightly firmer in early deals, with the yield falling 1.5 basis points to 10.010%.

Africa,/world/africa/,South Africa's Attacq posts 27.3% rise in distributable income,Reuters,2023-03-14 07:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZHKYNMCM7JLVVF5SQQ6BTMJPAI.jpg,"JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Reuters) - South African commercial property group Attacq (ATTJ.J) said on Tuesday its half-year distributable income rose by 27.3%, due to higher rental income, settlement of Cell C arrears and lower finance costs.
The company said distributable income per share, the primary measure of underlying financial performance in the listed property sector, rose to 35.9 cents in the six months ended Dec.31, from 28.2 cents a year earlier.
Rental income for the group increased by 4% to 1.2 billion rand ($65.77 million), mainly due to a rise in rental income from its super-regional Mall of Africa. Like-for-like rental income increased by 7.2%.
Turnovers and footcount for all its retail hubs continued to grow, with food services and apparel categories, which were the hardest hit during pandemic lockdowns, growing turnover by double digits, Attacq said.

Despite rolling power blackouts, which have dampened demand for some retailers, the increased footcount positively impacted trading densities, with the weighted average annual trading density- sales per square metre- for the total portfolio increasing by 14.7%.

Africa,/world/africa/,"Storm Freddy kills more than 100 on return to Mozambique, Malawi",Frank Phiri,2023-03-13 22:27:00+00:00,,"BLANTYRE, Malawi/MAPUTO, March 13 (Reuters) - Mozambique and Malawi on Monday were counting the cost of Tropical Storm Freddy, which killed more than 100 people, injured scores and left a trail of destruction as it ripped through southern Africa for the second time in a month over the weekend.
Freddy is one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the southern hemisphere and could be the longest-lasting tropical cyclone, according to the World Meteorological Organization.
It pummelled central Mozambique on Saturday, ripping roofs off buildings and bringing widespread flooding around the port of Quelimane, before moving inland towards Malawi with torrential rains that caused landslides.
The full extent of the damage and loss of life in Mozambique in particular is not yet clear, as the power supply and phone signals were cut off in some parts of the affected area.
The storm has killed 99 people in Malawi, including 85 in the main commercial hub of Blantyre, said the commissioner of the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, Charles Kalemba, at a press briefing.

The total number killed by storm Freddy in Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar since it first made landfall last month is now around 136.
The central hospital in Blantyre had received at least 60 bodies by early afternoon, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) country director Marion Pechayre told Reuters by telephone, adding that some 200 injured were being treated in the hospital.
The injuries were from falling trees, landslides and flash floods, she said. ""A lot of (houses) are mud houses with tin roofs, so the roofs fall on people's heads.""
Police spokesperson Peter Kalaya told Reuters that rescue teams had been looking for people in Chilobwe and Ndirande, two of the worst-affected townships in Blantyre, the country's second-largest city, where it was still raining on Monday and many residents were without power.
""Some missing people are feared buried in rubble,"" Kalaya said.

Malawi's national electricity company EGENCO said that power generation capacity was unstable and that it had experienced total system shutdown twice on Monday. It has shut down all major hydro power stations to protect them from damage, it said.
At least ten people died in Mozambique's Zambezia province, a provincial delegate from the National Institute of Disaster Risk Management, Nelson Ludovico, said on public broadcaster Radio Mozambique, adding that the figures were still provisional.
""The situation is critical in Zambezia province. We can't advance with an accurate picture of the scale of damage because there's no communications with all the regions,"" Health Minister Armindo Tiago said on public radio.
Guy Taylor, chief of advocacy, communications and partnerships for U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Mozambique, told Reuters from Quelimane that humanitarian agencies there did not have the capacity to deal with a disaster of this size.
""We saw a lot of destroyed buildings and clinics. People's homes had their roofs torn off by the wind. Even before the cyclone hit we saw localised flooding,"" he said.
The wind had died down on Monday but there was still a lot of flooding that had destroyed crops and created a risk of waterborne diseases, he said.
Mozambique has seen more than a year's worth of rainfall in the past four weeks.
Malawi has been battling the deadliest cholera outbreak in its history, and U.N. agencies have warned the situation could now get worse.
Scientists say fossil fuel-driven climate change is making tropical storms stronger, as oceans absorb heat from greenhouse gas emissions and when warm seawater evaporates heat energy is transferred to the atmosphere.

Africa,/world/africa/,South African court orders striking healthcare workers to end walkout,Reuters,2023-03-13 20:59:00+00:00,,"JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Reuters) - The South African Labour Appeal Court on Monday ordered striking state healthcare workers to end a week-long walkout that has affected services in some of the country's major hospitals, the health department said.
National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (NEHAWU) members went on strike last week after wage talks with the government failed.
The health department said on Sunday that clinical operations were hamstrung by a low nursing and administrative support staff turnout.
The court interdict will help stabilise services at the affected hospitals, the department said on Monday.
Striking workers have been ordered to go back to work by Tuesday morning, it said.
""The strike has disrupted provision of essential healthcare services in the country, leading to untold suffering and frustrations amongst the public who desperately needed healthcare and life-saving treatment,"" said South Africa's health minister Joe Phaahla.

The labour relations act prohibits essential workers from engaging in strike action which is detrimental to healthcare services with a risk of loss of life, he told a press briefing.
Union leaders could not be immediately reached for comment.
The union has been demanding a 10% wage hike, but the government offered 4.7%, according to local media SABC News.
The union said in a statement on Sunday that ""no amount of litigation or intimidation by the government will deter us from this noble worthy cause that we have embarked on"".
Employer demands to drop the dispute process ""is another demonstration of how far government is prepared to undermine and collapse collective bargaining and the dispute resolution mechanism by imposing their will on workers,"" NEHAWU union leader Zola Saphetha told a news conference on Sunday.
The South African military said it had deployed medics to help in the affected hospitals at the request of the health department.

Africa,/world/africa/,"Ivory Coast rains to strengthen cocoa mid-crop, farmers say",Reuters,2023-03-13 13:40:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LFBFT3Y7ABPIVA5E4MGCUNWHMA.jpg,"ABIDJAN, March 13 (Reuters) - Mainly above average rains last week in most of Ivory Coast's cocoa-growing regions were favourable for the April-to-September mid-crop, which is expected to start early and to be bigger than last year's output, farmers said on Monday.
Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, is in its dry season which runs officially from mid-November to March, when rains are poor and scarce.
Farmers across the country said last week's moisture would strengthen the development of fruit as plenty of average-sized and other pods were almost ripe on the trees.
Farmers said they now had a good sight of the mid-crop, which would start slowly by next week and pick up from mid-April. They added that the main part of the mid-crop would be done between May and June but significant volumes of beans would leave the bush in July and August.
""The last rains will help the trees a lot. The harvest will begin tentatively next week,"" said Salame Kone, who farms near the western region of Soubre, where 18.3 millimetres (mm) fell last week, 7.3 mm above the five-year average.

Similar comments were made in the southern region of Agboville and in the eastern region of Abengourou, where rains were well above the average. Rains were below the average in the southern region of Divo, but farmers said rainfall had been just right for the development of pods.
In the centre-western region of Daloa, where rains were below the average, and in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro, where rains were well above the average last week, farmers said they were happy with the weather but more downpours during the coming weeks would help tiny cocoa pods to survive as the weather remained too hot.
""If we have at least two abundant rains well distributed this month, many small pods will reach maturity for plentiful harvests of the mid-crop,"" said Celestin Affessi, who farms near Bongouanou, where 23.8 mm fell last week, 9.2 mm above the average.
Average temperatures ranged from 28.1 to 32.4 degrees Celsius in Ivory Coast last week.

Africa,/world/africa/,Kagame looking at 'resolving' detention of 'Hotel Rwanda' hero Rusesabagina,Reuters,2023-03-13 11:13:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/W2CDZTFFUBKGDLAUJNAB3IQ3XI.jpg,"NAIROBI, March 13 (Reuters) - Rwandan President Paul Kagame on Monday said there were discussions about ""resolving"" the fate of Paul Rusesabagina, who was portrayed as a hero in the Hollywood film ""Hotel Rwanda"" and is serving a 25-year sentence in Rwanda on terrorism charges.
Rusesabagina was sentenced in September 2021 over his ties to an organization opposed to Kagame's rule. He denied all the charges and refused to take part in the trial that he and his supporters called a political sham.
Washington has designated him as ""wrongly detained"", partly because of what it called the lack of fair trial guarantees. Rusesabagina has U.S. permanent residency rights.
Kagame has said his country would not be bullied over Rusesabagina, but on Monday appeared to suggest that there was room for compromise.
""We don't get stuck with our past. We move into the future,"" Kagame said during a video interview at the Global Security Forum.

""So there is discussion, there is looking at all possible ways of resolving that issue without compromising the most fundamental aspects of that case.""
In August U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had raised his concerns with Kagame over the trial. Rwanda has said the trial was lawful.
Rusesabagina was feted around the world after being played by actor Don Cheadle in the 2004 film ""Hotel Rwanda"". The movie portrayed him as a hero who risked his life to shelter hundreds of people as manager of a luxury hotel during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Rusesabagina, a vocal critic of Kagame, acknowledged having a leadership role in the opposition group but denied responsibility for attacks carried out by its armed wing. The trial judges said the two were indistinguishable.
Rights groups say Rusesabagina's jailing is an example of Kagame using authoritarian tactics to crush political opposition and extend his more than two decades in power, allegations the president denies.

Americas,/world/americas/,Colombian president accuses criminal group of breaking ceasefire,Reuters,2023-03-13 20:54:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/T236SCQKHJPUBHY7MEMOTMLFJY.jpg,"BOGOTA, March 13 (Reuters) - Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Monday said the Clan del Golfo, the country's largest criminal organization, has broken a ceasefire and there is no possibility of negotiations with the group if they continue attacks.
The ceasefire with the Clan - also known as the Gaitanista Self-Defense Forces (AGC) - was part of efforts to end the group's part in Colombia's internal conflict, which has killed at least 450,000 people.
In a radio interview, Petro accused the group of destroying a municipal aqueduct in Antioquia province amid roadblocks connected to protests by informal gold miners.
The roadblocks have affected up to 300,000 people across 12 municipalities in two provinces, resulting in shortages of fuel, food and medicine. Police lifted the majority of the roadblocks last week.
""By breaking the pipes, they have left Taraza without drinking water. The Clan del Golfo versus humble people,"" Petro said in a Twitter message on Sunday.
View 2 more stories 
The group ""has broken the ceasefire,"" he said.
In a separate radio interview on Monday, Petro said there was ""obviously no possibility of negotiation"" with the group if they were not capable of setting aside illegal business interests.
The group did not immediately respond to Petro's statements.
Gold miner Mineros SA has suspended operations in the region until it can guarantee security, it said in a statement.
Petro's government has asked Congress to pass a law approving surrender for gangs, including reduced prison sentences, in exchange for halting operations and paying reparations to victims.
Meanwhile, the miners' protests are ongoing, with attacks on medical facilities, property destruction and roadblocks, with encouragement from the Clan del Golfo, according to the military, police and government.
The protests intensified after the military has stepped up operations and soldiers destroyed 13 excavators in the last fortnight, aiming to clamp down on illegal and informal gold mining.
The practice is considered an environmental disaster due to the destruction it wreaks on numerous ecosystems, including mercury contamination in rivers.
Negotiations between the government and the miners have not yet resulted in a deal.
The government's National Mining Agency (ANM) last year said it would create a public company to help informal miners and put a dent in Colombia's illegal gold trade.

Americas,/world/americas/,Colombia prosecutor suspends warrant for FARC dissidents in step toward talks,Reuters,2023-03-13 20:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QQPRMU2ESNIM5NYV5GSCZSUX4M.jpg,"BOGOTA, March 13 (Reuters) - Colombia's attorney general on Monday suspended arrest warrants against 19 members of a group of former rebels who reject a 2016 peace deal, a step toward new negotiations promised by President Gustavo Petro.
The Estado Mayor Central armed group was founded by former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels who did not join that group's demobilization and conversion to a legal political party.
Petro has vowed to end Colombia's 60-year conflict - which has killed at least 450,000 people - by inking peace or surrender deals with remaining rebels and crime gangs and by fully implementing the FARC accord.
""The attorney general of the nation, after weighing the arguments presented by President Petro, and in accordance with his legal and constitutional duties, has decided to suspend existing and future arrest warrants against 19 people,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement.

None of the 19 have extradition warrants, the prosecutor's office said.
The suspension will allow discussions to take place between the dissidents and government officials, Petro said on Twitter - a first step to beginning formal talks.
""A second peace process is beginning,"" Petro tweeted, adding discussions would be established between the government and the group.
The government is already in peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and the two sides have said they are progressing toward a bilateral ceasefire deal.
The country's top peace official told Reuters last month the government expects talks with the Estado Mayor and Segunda Marquetalia, another FARC dissident group, within weeks.
The government is holding a ceasefire with the dissident groups and some crime gangs, though Petro said on Thursday that the Clan del Golfo criminal group had broken its deal.
The attorney general said in January he would not drop extradition warrants for drug-trafficking bosses, with whom Petro wants to agree surrender deals.

Americas,/world/americas/,"'Mexico is safer than the U.S.', Mexican president says",Dave Graham,2023-03-13 19:12:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XFLUJMHALFMRBN4OPBQT3JMTKE.jpg,"MEXICO CITY, March 13 (Reuters) - Mexico's president said on Monday his country is safer than the United States, pushing back against U.S. critics of his security record following a deadly kidnapping this month near the border that claimed the lives of two Americans.
The March 3 attack on four Americans in the Mexican city of Matamoros and their subsequent abduction was covered closely by U.S. media and sparked recriminations from politicians in the U.S., particularly Republicans.
By the time Mexican authorities found the Americans, two of them were dead. Five purported Mexican drug cartel members have since been arrested over the kidnapping.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has threatened to urge Mexican-Americans not to vote for Republican candidates if they continue their criticism, rejected U.S. official security warnings that depict much of Mexico as a risky place to visit.

""Mexico is safer than the United States,"" he told reporters when questioned about the warnings at a news conference. ""There's no problem with traveling safely around Mexico.""
Lopez Obrador said American tourists and Mexicans living in the U.S. were aware of how safe the country is, and pointed to a recent rise in Americans residing in Mexico. Last year saw a sharp jump in U.S. tourists coming to Mexico.
He blamed an ""anti-Mexico"" campaign by conservative U.S politicians for negative reports about security.
The U.S. embassy in Mexico did not respond to a request for comment about the president's comments.
At 28 per 100,000 people, Mexico's murder rate was around four times higher than in the United States in 2020, according to data published by the World Bank. Homicides fell about 7% last year in Mexico, but the current government is on track to register a record total for any six-year administration.
The U.S. State Department assigns varying levels of travel risk to all but two of Mexico's 32 regions.
On top of the kidnappings, U.S. police say two women from Texas have been missing in Mexico since late February when they drove across the border to sell clothes at a flea market.
A spokesperson for police in Penitas, near McAllen, said sisters Marina Perez Rios, 48, and Maritza Trinidad Perez Rios, 47, and their Mexican friend, Dora Alicia Cervantes Saenz, 53, have been unaccounted for since Feb. 27, and the FBI had been alerted.
Meanwhile, authorities in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, which has been racked by severe gang violence, said seven women - including a group of six - had been reported missing in the state during the last week.
Separately, an attack by gunmen in a bar in the town of Apaseo El Grande, Guanajuato, on Saturday night has claimed the lives of 10 people, a spokesperson for state prosecutors said. Prosecutors first reported eight dead, but two more people injured in the shooting have since died, the official said.

""We have enquiries in progress, hearings taking place, and at some point, the former president will be subpoenaed,"" Dino told reporters after an event in Rio de Janeiro.
There was no deadline or date set for Bolsonaro to be subpoenaed, the minister said, adding that if the former president - who is in self-imposed exile in the United States - fails to testify, Brazil ""may or may not"" seek international legal cooperation.
Luxury jewelry gifted to the then-president and his wife Michelle Bolsonaro by the Saudi government was seized by customs officials in October 2021 after it was found in the backpack of a government aide. Several officials from the Bolsonaro administration unsuccessfully tried to recover the jewelry from customs, according to local media.
Brazilians are allowed to bring in $1,000 of goods or gifts and pay hefty taxes for anything over that value.

Bolsonaro has previously denied any wrongdoing.
On Monday, Bolsonaro's lawyer said in a letter to the police that the former president will deliver accounts of a second gift he received from the Saudi government to a Brazilian court.
The lawyer stressed that at no time Bolsonaro ""intended to enrich himself with property that could, in any way, be regarded as public"", also asking that the second set of jewelry be held in public custody until the conclusion of the investigation.
According to the minister, police will conclude the investigation into whether or not Bolsonaro attends a hearing.
""The deposition is an opportunity for his defense ... We are facing facts that have documentary proof, images, film, officers and papers, material evidence, and there are hearings, oral evidence,"" said Dino.

Americas,/world/americas/,"Nicaragua closes Vatican embassy in Managua, Nicaraguan embassy to Vatican",Philip Pullella,2023-03-12 20:18:00+00:00,,"VATICAN CITY, March 12 (Reuters) - Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has ordered the closure of the Vatican Embassy in Managua and that of the Nicaraguan Embassy to the Vatican in Rome, a senior Vatican source said on Sunday.
Nicaragua signalled that the move, which came a few days after Pope Francis compared the Nicaraguan government to a dictatorship, was ""a suspension"" of diplomatic relations.
The Vatican source said that while the closures do not automatically mean a total break of relations between Managua and the Holy See, they are serious steps towards that possibility.
Ortega's administration has been increasingly isolated internationally since he began cracking down heavily on dissent following street protests that erupted in 2018. Ortega called the protests an attempted coup against his government.
Bishop Rolando Alvarez, a vocal critic of Ortega, was sentenced to more than 26 years in prison in Nicaragua last month on charges that included treason, undermining national integrity and spreading false news.
View 2 more stories 
Alvazez was convicted after he refused to leave the country along with 200 political prisoners released by Ortega's government and sent to the United States. Alvarez refused to board the plane and was stripped of his citizenship.
In an interview published last week with Latin American online news outlet Infobae ahead of Monday's 10th anniversary of his pontificate, the pope pointed to Alvarez's imprisonment and likened what was happening in Nicaragua to the ""1917 Communist dictatorship or that of Hitler in 1935"".
Staff in both embassies had been down to barebones for years with only a chargé d'affaires for the Vatican in Managua and almost no one for Nicaragua in Rome.
The relationship between the Nicaraguan Catholic Church and the government has been severely strained since the crackdown on the anti-government protests in 2018, when the Church acted as a mediator between both sides.
The Church had called for justice for more than 360 people who died during the unrest.
Nicaraguan Bishop Silvio Baez, also a critic of the government, went into exile in 2019.
A year ago, the Vatican protested to Nicaragua over the effective expulsion of its ambassador, saying the unilateral action was unjustified and incomprehensible.
Archbishop Waldemar Sommertag, who had been critical of Nicaragua's slide away from democracy, had to leave the country suddenly after the government withdrew its approval of the envoy.

Americas,/world/americas/,"U.S. not negotiating new Venezuela prisoner swap despite appeal, say U.S. officials",Jonathan Landay,2023-03-12 10:17:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZW7CHNN6EFPPPBX62BU6MWFK7Q.jpg,"WASHINGTON/CARACAS, March 12 (Reuters) - The United States is not discussing a prisoner exchange as described in a letter and video appeal addressed to President Joe Biden by an American detained in Venezuela, according to two U.S. officials.
Eyvin Hernandez was ""quite possibly coerced"" into appealing to Biden to swap him and seven other U.S. detainees for Alex Saab, a Colombian-born businessman facing trial in Miami, said one of the U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Hernandez, a 35-year-old Los Angeles public defender, sent the letter and video to Biden in February.
""I'm making this appeal to you on behalf of myself, my family, my friends, and all the other U.S. Americans that are here, unlawfully detained in Venezuela,"" Hernandez said in the video, which was reviewed by Reuters and is being reported for the first time. ""We know that we will be released if you make a trade for Alex Saab for all of us.""

His letter, also reviewed by Reuters, was previously reported by Newsweek.
The Venezuelan Ministry of Information did not respond to questions about whether a prisoner swap was being considered, or whether Hernandez was coerced into making his appeal.
In the video, Hernandez says swapping him and the other detainees for Saab, a long-time ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, would be the ""only way"" they could be freed.
Saab is charged with siphoning around $350 million out of Venezuela through the U.S. in a bribery scheme linked to Venezuela's state-controlled exchange rate. He denies the allegation. No date has been set for his trial.
Declining to comment on the specifics of any ongoing case, a U.S. State Department spokesperson appeared to indicate that talks on a prisoner swap involving Saab might be possible after his trial ran its course.
The spokesperson cautioned against any reporting that suggested a deal had been reached to secure the release of an American wrongfully detained in Venezuela, ""or that there are active conversations about releasing a major U.S. criminal suspect who hasn't even gone to trial.""
The first U.S. official also said no negotiations were underway.
Hernandez' brother, Henry Martinez, told Reuters by WhatsApp from Los Angeles that the family had received no official information from U.S. officials about any possible exchange.
Biden says freeing Americans wrongfully detained overseas is a top priority. He has presided over a number of swaps, notably one in December in which basketball star Brittney Griner was released by Moscow in exchange for convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.
In the video, Hernandez was unshaven. He appeared well-fed, sitting in a green sweatshirt over a blue shirt and pants. The hand-written letter lay on a desk before him.
Reuters was unable to learn how the video and letter were conveyed to the White House. That Hernadez was allowed to make them indicated Venezuelan authorities approved.
In his letter, Hernandez wrote that his appeal for was backed by three other U.S. detainees: Jerrel Kenemore, Jason Saad and Joseph Cristella.
The Biden administration in October declared Hernandez wrongfully detained. He and Kenemore, 53, were arrested in March 2022 on charges of illegally entering Venezuela from Colombia.
Caracas in October released seven Americans in exchange for two of Maduro's relatives convicted on drug trafficking charges in the United States, amid talks between U.S. and Venezuelan officials that began in March 2022.
The talks marked a shift in U.S. policy from the Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" campaign of sanctions and other measures aimed at forcing Maduro from power following 2018 elections widely deemed fraudulent.
Venezuela has the world's largest proven oil reserves. The Biden administration has been seeking alternative oil sources because of disruptions related to the war in Ukraine.
Washington says Maduro's government must take concrete steps toward free elections and release detained politicians before it considers any easing of sanctions.

Americas,/world/americas/,"In Peru's Andes, scars of protest deaths cut deep as families seek justice",Alexander Villegas,2023-03-11 22:24:00+00:00,,"JULIACA, Peru, March 11 (Reuters) - In a small bedroom of a tin-roofed home in Peru's southern city of Juliaca, Asunta Jumpiri holds the torn red and black sweatshirt of her 15-year-old son, whose dark eyes stare back at her from half a dozen framed photos around the room.
Her son Brayan was wearing it when he was shot in the back of the head on Jan. 9, the deadliest day of violence Peru has seen in over twenty years that has cut a deep scar in the country's Andean south.
Brayan had come into town with his mother, 9-year-old younger brother and pregnant older sister to visit the doctor. Brayan then asked to go to an Internet cafe and they arranged to meet up later at a nearby crossroads, his mother recounted.
Instead, Brayan was caught up in the protests. Security camera footage obtained by Reuters shows the moment he was shot, identifiable by his distinctive red-black sweatshirt.

Brayan died of his wounds three days later on Jan. 12 in hospital after surgeons tried to clear a blockage in the brain. His autopsy showed he had a fractured skull and died from head trauma caused by a firearm projectile.
""Do you think we're going to forgive?"" Brayan's mother, Jumpiri, told Reuters at her home. ""No, we're not going to forgive. I'm willing to fight. I'm willing to die. For Peru I'm willing to fight. I'm not afraid now that my son is dead.""
Peru, home to some 35 million people, huge copper reserves and the ancient Incan city Machu Picchu, is grappling to restore stability after months of anti-government protests and clashes that have left 49 people dead, with roads blockaded around the country and calls for the president and Congress to step down.
Growing calls for justice pose a hurdle to restoring peace, broken by the dramatic Dec. 7 ouster of leftist President Pedro Castillo.
Since the first protest death in mid-December, prosecutors have opened at least 11 investigations into the deaths of some of the people killed during clashes with security forces.
The prosecutor's office in Juliaca said they were not authorized to discuss the investigations and police declined to comment.
There has been a lull in clashes since their peak but anger is simmering.

Zarai Toledo, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Inter-American Policy and Research (CIPR) who has studied social conflicts in Peru, says the current wave of protests is unlike any she's seen since the country's return to democracy, and the lack of perceived accountability is dangerous for democracy.
""The country is super unpredictable, but this level of repression can help us argue that those that have been the victims of repression will not stop,"" Toledo said.
Brayan was one of 19 people killed in Juliaca. Scars of the violence are scattered around town, etched into the streets and buildings: charred shells of cars, burning tires and broken glass litter the roads. Anti-government banners hang from overpasses calling for the president to step down.
Family members of the victims have joined together, getting legal support and forming an association to spur authorities to action. They’re coordinating with families and organizations around the country representing those killed during the protests to file a lawsuit against President Dina Boluarte and other members of the government.
Boluarte has said there will be no ""impunity"" when it comes to protest deaths, but families say they've seen little progress.
Rosa Luque criticized the authorities for not doing enough to collect evidence after her 18-year-old son, Heliot Luque, was shot and killed at around 5.30pm on Jan. 9. He died from a single gunshot to the chest, his autopsy shows.
""Aren't they supposed to be the authorities and isn't it their duty to do that?"" Luque said.
Hundreds of protesters have been arrested, with several sentenced to jail, as the government has taken a tough line on protest violence, including threatening stiff jail terms for people supporting what it calls ""terrorist"" acts online.
""They don't immediately investigate the deaths, but the (protesters) who do damage or lead things, they're already in prison. Our dead aren't worth anything,"" said Dionisio Aroquipa, whose 17-year old daughter, Jhamlith Nataly, died on Jan 9.
Investigators found a 9 millimeter (mm) bullet lodged in her body according to an autopsy report seen by Reuters.
""We're asking for justice, for an in-depth investigation. I want to know who it was that pulled the trigger,"" Aroquipa said.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,South Korea's Yoon to meet Japan's Kishida in Tokyo on Thursday,Reuters,2023-03-14 06:24:00+00:00,,"SEOUL, March 14 (Reuters) - South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol will travel to Japan for talks on Thursday with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, a South Korean official said, days after South Korea announced a plan to end a row between the U.S. allies over wartime forced labour.
Yoon's two-day visit to Japan from Thursday will be the first such trip by a South Koran leader in 12 years.
""This visit ... will be an important milestone in the improvement of relations between South Korea and Japan which has been promoted by the Yoon administration since inauguration,"" Yoon's national security adviser, Kim Sung-han, told a briefing on Tuesday.
South Korea announced last week that its companies would compensate victims of forced labour under Japan's colonial rule from 1910-1945, seeking to end a dispute that has undermined U.S.-led efforts to present a unified front against China and North Korea.

Taiwan has engaged an array of foreign submarine-technology vendors for its new fleet, with the approval of their governments, as it seeks to bolster its defences in the face of a rising military threat from China, which views the island as its own territory.
Asked about the Reuters report on the rise in British parts and technology sales to Taiwan, Chiu said the submarine programme was ""very important work"".
""There are indeed many difficulties. At present, everything is going according to plan,"" he told reporters at parliament, declining direct comment on the story. ""We're working hard on this major construction.""
Taiwan has for decades been unable to buy conventional submarines from other countries because of their concerns about angering China.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Indonesia parliament won't allow power vacuum over election ruling - deputy speaker,Reuters,2023-03-14 05:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/RMIME3QE7BNPNEY7V6FHLF2A74.jpg,"JAKARTA, March 14 (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament will ensure there is no vacuum of power in the country despite a controversial court ruling to delay the 2024 presidential and general elections, its deputy speaker said on Tuesday.
The surprise March 2 decision by a Jakarta district court, which law experts say it had no authority to make, has added fuel to a lingering debate on whether President Joko Widodo should be allowed to stay in power longer, despite him next year reaching the two-term limit set by the constitution.
Deputy house speaker Lodewijk F. Paulus on Tuesday told parliament the constitution makes clear that elections must be held every five years.
""The Indonesian parliament will give extra attention to the resolution of these legal issues, so that there will not be a vacuum of executive or legislative powers,"" he said.
He did not elaborate on steps parliament could take.
The election commission appealed the ruling last week and has said it would proceed with poll preparations as normal, despite the court ordering those be stopped for more than two years.

It is not clear when a decision on the appeal will be made.
The case was brought by a little-known party that was formed in 2021 and has no election history, which said its application to register had been unfairly denied by the poll body.
Jokowi, as the president is known, backs the appeal against the ruling and has said he is against the idea of extending his tenure.
The prospect of allowing a third term for the leader of the world's third-largest democracy has been floated by some of his political allies, but opinion polls so far indicate many Indonesians would be against it.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Taiwan says it hopes to bring back soldier who went to China,Reuters,2023-03-14 02:10:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZOFTTWTUVVNUDLEBMZDBLZTNDI.jpg,"TAIPEI, March 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan's defence minister said on Tuesday that the government is investigating the disappearance of a soldier serving on an offshore island who has been found in China, and vowed to bring him back.
Speaking to reporters at parliament, Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said: ""We certainly hope to bring him back home. So how will we get him back? There are alternative channels we are pursuing.""
He did not elaborate on those channels.
The minister denied what he called rumours that the soldier had fled from abusive treatment by the military.
When asked whether there was any risk that the missing soldier could disclose classified military deployment and location information, he replied, ""Regardless of whether he has any such capability, which we neither confirm nor deny, we would not need to make any large-scale strategic adjustments to mitigate any information provided by this one individual.""

The soldier, serving on Erdan islet close to the Chinese coast, went missing last week and was found on Monday.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office has not commented on the issue.
China, which views Taiwan as its own territory, has over the past three years stepped up military and political pressure to try and get Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. Taiwan's government rejects those claims.
During the height of the Cold War, defectors from both sides would on occasion swim between China and Kinmen.
At its nearest point, from the Mashan observation post, the main island of Kinmen is at low tide less than 2km (1.6 miles) from Chinese-controlled territory.
It was from there former World Bank chief economist Justin Lin swam across to defect to China in 1979.
Taiwan has controlled Kinmen, as well as the Matsu islands further up the Chinese coast, since the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People's Republic of China.

A few hundred Khan supporters gathered outside the house after a police team arrived from Islamabad to arrest him on a court order, government spokesman Amir Mir told Reuters.
Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers started the violence, which injured several police officials, Mir said, adding, ""If Imran Khan ensures his presence in the court, it will be good, otherwise the law will take its course.""
Mir said the government has called out paramilitary forces to control the situation.
Several of Khan's supporters were injured when the police resorted to teargas shelling, witnesses said.

Similar clashes took places last week.
""We have come here just for the compliance of the court order,"" deputy inspector general of police Syed Shahzad Nadeem told reporters.
The workers started pelting the police with stones and bricks, and in response police directed a water cannon at them and in some cases baton charged them, he said.
Live TV footage showed the supporters also using sling-shots and attacking the police with bricks and sticks.
""Our understanding is that the police can't arrest Imrabn Khan because he has secured a protective bail from a high court,"" his aide Shah Mehmood Qureshi told reporters.
The court in Islamabad had issued the arrest warrants in a case against Khan on charges of threatening a judge in one of his speeches last year.
The former premier has been embroiled in several court cases since his ousting early last year in a parliament vote of confidence.
He has been demanding snap polls in protest rallies across the country, a move his successor Shehbaz Sharif has rejected, saying the elections would be held as scheduled later this year.
Khan was also shot and wounded in one of these rallies.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Rebounding New Zealand tourism is a rare bright spot for its economy,Lucy Craymer,2023-03-14 08:39:00+00:00,,"WELLINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - When cruises started taking bookings at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australians Eunice and John Rowley quickly made plans for their first ever visit to New Zealand.
""We heard on the 9 o’clock news bulletin that they were opening up cruises and by the afternoon we had two cruises booked,” said Eunice, who is travelling with her husband on the Grand Princess around New Zealand.
""We’d never been to New Zealand, so we thought this is our opportunity.”
New Zealand’s international tourist sector disappeared overnight when the country became one of the first to seal its borders at the beginning of the COVID outbreak in early 2020.
But since borders fully reopened in August, foreign tourists have been making their way back and are responsible for one of the main bright spots for an economy battling headwinds as a possible recession looms.
International visitor numbers in January were already back to two-thirds of what they were before the pandemic began, according to the latest data released on Tuesday by Statistics New Zealand.
View 2 more stories 
""It’s been pretty busy across our portfolio,” said Stephen England-Hall, chief executive RealNZ, which operates a number of tourist activities in New Zealand's South Island such as cruises and jet-boat rides.
He said while not yet back to 2019 levels, demand over the New Zealand summer had been much higher than they had anticipated, with independent travellers in particular fuelling the recovery.
He said arrivals at some airports were actually higher than in 2019 but those good figures were offset by fewer tourists visiting by car, camper van and bus.
Before the pandemic, tourism was New Zealand's largest source of foreign exchange and accounted for about 5.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).
The reviving sector is expected to have supported growth in the quarter to December. The data is out on Thursday and is expected to show a 0.2% contraction in the fourth quarter.
Some tourism-related industries have even been performing better than before the pandemic.
Food and accommodation is up 10.3% on pre-pandemic levels, according to an analysis of Statistics NZ GDP data for the September 2022 quarter by the Wellington-based economics consultancy Infometrics.
Tourists are having to spend more because inflation in New Zealand is near a three-decade high but Brad Olsen, principal economist at Infometrics, said it was difficult to fully understand why the figure was up so much.
""Solid tourism activity is likely to partially but not fully offset weaker construction, retail, and manufacturing activity,"" Olsen said.
While tourist arrivals from the likes of Australia and the United States were returning to normal levels, the numbers for several markets, including China, remain well below pre-pandemic numbers.
China in January allowed group tours to 20 countries as it threw off its strict COVID policy, with New Zealand on this list along with Thailand and Russia.
The first Chinese groups arrived in February.
“The recovery varies from market to market based on airline connectivity and the late removal of COVID restrictions last year compared to other countries lifting travel restrictions earlier,” said Tourism Export Council New Zealand chief executive Lynda Keene.
Higher numbers of Chinese visitors are expected to begin showing up in the February and March data, she said.
“It's encouraging to see we’re tracking in an upward direction,” she said.

Asia Pacific,/world/asia-pacific/,Nepal seeks easier trade access to Chinese markets,Gopal Sharma,2023-03-14 12:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZVBFL75U4RMGREQGSFH2QQTO2U.jpg,"KATHMANDU, March 14 (Reuters) - Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Tuesday asked China to provide ""easy and more generous"" market access to products from the Himalayan country to help narrow its wide trade deficit with Beijing.
The landlocked Himalayan nation of 30 million people has traditionally looked to India for economic support and trade, but Nepal has increasingly been courted by China with transport, trade and transit deals, to New Delhi's unease.
Nepal's imports from China fell to $1.84 billion in 2022 from $2.38 billion a year ago, while exports totalled $5.39 million, down from $8.37 million in the same period, official data showed.
""Nepal's growing trade deficit with China and the apparent gaps in commitment and actual investment of FDI from China"" are some of the issues that needed a practical solution, Dahal told a business meeting organised by the Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI) and China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) in Kathmandu.

China is among the top investors in Nepal's infrastructure. Beijing accounts for 14% of Nepal's international trade while India holds nearly two-thirds of it, trade officials said.
In 2016, China agreed to allow Nepal to use its ports for trading goods with other countries. Beijing will also help Nepal construct a trans-Himalayan railway network linking Kathmandu with the Tibet region of China.
Dahal said Nepal also sought help from China in improving productive capacity in a range of its products and asked for duty free access for Nepali vegetables, meat products, tea and herbal products to China.
He had requested China to give access to ""some 512 tradable Nepali products"" to the country's duty-free and quota-free market, he said.
""Trade is the engine of growth and our future prosperity lies in our capacity to produce and trade more,"" Dahal added.
China allows duty and quota free entry to 8,030 items from least-developed countries including Nepal, officials said.

China,/world/china/,China's parliament approves changes to speed up 'emergency' laws,Laurie Chen,2023-03-13 04:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HOGJSUEYIJJ53EJXVFAQLNAJKQ.jpg,"BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - China's parliament approved changes to a law on Monday that would allow it to pass emergency legislation more quickly, the official Xinhua news agency reported, a move that analysts say could further erode public debate and scrutiny.
The amendment to the Legislation Law, which governs how laws are enacted, gives the highest body of the national parliament, the roughly 170-member National People's Congress Standing Committee, special powers to pass laws after just one review session.
It is an ""important measure"" to ""further improve the quality and efficiency of legislation"", and an ""inevitable requirement for strengthening the (ruling Communist) party's overall leadership over legislative work"", according to readouts from delegates' meetings published during the annual parliamentary gathering, which closed on Monday morning.
Draft laws and amendments in China are normally published to solicit public comments, and are voted in by its rubber-stamp parliament after being deliberated during at least two meetings of the NPC Standing Committee, a process that can take several months.

However, there have been exceptions in the past.
Three years ago, China imposed a national security law on the semiautonomous city of Hong Kong, criminalising a broad range of vaguely defined offences intended to stifle dissent.
Critics say that legislation, also passed after being reviewed only once by the NPC Standing Committee, further eroded the rule of law in Hong Kong and crushed the financial hub's freedoms.
China has repeatedly brushed off criticism of the law, saying it protects Hong Kong residents' freedoms and only targets a small minority of ""criminals"" who ""endanger national security"".
Julian Ku, professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University in New York, said the amended Legislation Law could be ""abused and may well be abused in ramming through laws without much consultation or public notice.""
The latest draft of the law, published March 5, did not define what constitutes an emergency situation. The final text has not yet been made public.

China,/world/china/,Factbox: Key takeaways from China's annual NPC parliamentary meeting,Laurie Chen,2023-03-13 06:25:00+00:00,,"BEIJING, March 13 (Reuters) - China's rubber-stamp parliament concluded its annual meeting on Monday, during which Xi Jinping was confirmed as president for a precedent-breaking third term and installed many of his allies in top government roles.
Here are key takeaways from the nearly nine-day long gathering known as the National People's Congress (NPC):
Nearly 3,000 members of the NPC voted unanimously in Beijing's Great Hall of the People for the reinstatement 69-year-old Xi in an election in which there was no other candidate. Xi had already clinched a third term as head of the ruling Communist Party at a congress in October.
Many of the top state roles went to current or former members of the elite Politburo Standing Committee, the party's highest echelon of power. These include Premier Li Qiang, NPC Chairperson Zhao Leji, Executive Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang, and Vice President Han Zheng.
But China unexpectedly retained central bank governor Yi Gang and finance minister Liu Kun in their posts, despite both having reached the ministerial-level retirement age of 65.

New Premier Li sought to reassure the country's private sector during his media debut.
The former Communist Party chief of Shanghai and close ally of Xi struck a business-friendly tone, promising equal treatment for private and state firms, and that the environment for entrepreneurial businesses will improve.
China's private sector has been rattled in recent years by a sweeping regulatory clampdown targeting some of its most vibrant industries, including the internet and private education.
Lawmakers endorsed a relatively conservative annual growth target of around 5% this year, lower than some analysts' expectations of up to 6%.
The closely-watched figure is a barometer of China's economic confidence as it faces multiple headwinds, from worsening relations with the United States and its allies to an uneven domestic economic recovery.
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by just 3% last year, one of its worst showings in decades, squeezed by three years of COVID-19 restrictions.
Xi in a speech on Monday vowed to modernise China's military to make it a ""Great Wall of Steel"", calling on the country to step up efforts to defend national security amid mounting tensions with the United States.
He also said that China must achieve greater self-reliance and strength in science and technology, a call that comes as the United States blocks China's access to chip making equipment and other cutting-edge technologies.
In a closed-door meeting with government advisers last Monday, shortly after the sessions began, Xi said the West, led by the United States, ""has implemented all-round containment to suppress China"", according to state media.
China's parliament also approved the biggest government reorganisation since 2018, including the formation of a new financial regulation body, national data bureau and a revamp of its science and technology ministry, as well as a 5% cut to central government staff headcounts.
The new national financial regulatory administration will replace the existing banking and insurance watchdog and oversee all aspects of China's $57 trillion financial sector apart from the securities market. It will report to the State Council, or cabinet.
The reform is intended to further consolidate financial regulation under one government body instead of across different institutions.
The full extent of the sweeping government reforms remains unclear, with further details including personnel appointments expected to be released in the coming weeks.
Analysts are watching for the plan to reform Communist Party bodies, expected to be released in coming weeks. These are likely to carry more weight since many new commissions will be overseeing the new ministries.
A new Central Science and Technology Commission under the Communist Party will be established to oversee the revamped science ministry, according to the government reform plan presented to parliament.
A separate top-level party financial watchdog, the Central Financial Work Commission, is likely to be resurrected after the NPC, sources earlier told Reuters. It will be headed by a member of the elite seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the sources said. This will likely have responsibility for the new state financial regulator.

China,/world/china/,China vows to ensure normal operations during institutional reforms,Reuters,2023-03-14 12:15:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/6C3M7ROVEZIYZGNI722UON3FQE.jpg,"BEIJING, March 14 (Reuters) - China will carefully implement state institutional reforms and ensure orderly operations, state media reported, citing the first cabinet meeting chaired by the new premier Li Qiang on Tuesday.
Li, the former Communist Party chief of Shanghai, was installed as premier on Saturday during the annual session of China's parliament and is tasked with reviving the world's second-largest economy after three years of COVID-19 curbs.
The institutional reforms remain ""a major political task at present"" and China will make sure that all the work is carried out normally, state media reported, citing comments from the meeting.
""The institutional reforms should be taken as an opportunity to adapt to the needs of building a new development pattern and promoting high-quality development.""
Last week, China's parliament approved a plan for a sweeping reform of central government institutions, including the formation of a financial regulatory body and national data bureau and a revamp of its science and technology ministry.

Analysts and investors said the new financial watchdog, the National Financial Regulatory Administration, will help bridge regulatory gaps, but it may also consolidate power at the top and could introduce more state and party intervention.
The new cabinet chaired by Li faces the challenge of getting the economy back on track after COVID-19 restrictions, weak consumer and business sentiment, slow global growth and geopolitical uncertainties.
The National Bureau of Statistics will release the country's economic activity data for the first two months combined on Wednesday, offering a snapshot to measure the strength of economic revival after the lifting of the anti-virus curbs late last year.

Europe,/world/europe/,Kremlin says AUKUS submarine deal raises proliferation questions,Reuters,2023-03-14 11:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7Q2EXSMVRZPB3BXKQV4AEQAQS4.jpg,"MOSCOW, March 14 (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday that a joint plan by the United States, Britain and Australia to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines raised questions about nuclear proliferation.
The leaders of the three countries on Monday announced details of the plan as part of their ""AUKUS"" partnership pact.
It would provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines from the early 2030s to counter China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""There are a lot of questions here related to the problem of non-proliferation. Here we need special transparency, and we need to answer the questions that arise.""
Peskov did not elaborate on the nature of Russia's concerns, though China has previously argued that supplying Australia with the submarines, which are conventionally armed but powered by very highly enriched uranium, amounted to an act of nuclear proliferation.
View 2 more stories 
U.S. President Joe Biden stressed at Monday's meeting with the British and Australian prime ministers in San Diego that the submarines would be nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed.
""These boats will not have nuclear weapons of any kind on them,"" he said.
To date no party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) other than the five countries the treaty recognises as weapons states - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - has nuclear-powered submarines. The vessels can stay underwater for longer than conventional ones and are harder to detect.
Russia's own Pacific Fleet has 17 submarines including three ballistic missile subs that are part of its strategic nuclear deterrent, according to the latest annual report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been critical of AUKUS since its inception in 2021, accusing it of fuelling regional tensions by trying to counter China.
Australia says it will be unable and unwilling to use the fuel in its submarines to make nuclear weapons since the vessels will have ""welded power units"" containing nuclear material that would need chemical processing for use in an atom bomb, and Australia does not have or want facilities that can do that.
The AUKUS countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) say the NPT allows so-called marine nuclear propulsion provided necessary arrangements are made with the IAEA.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised the West for not doing enough to remove obstacles to Russia's own agricultural and fertiliser exports and said contacts over the deal would continue.
Asked why Russia had extended the deal for 60 days - as opposed to the 120-day extension period set out in the agreement - Peskov said Moscow's decision was ""a gesture of goodwill ... in the hope that after such a long time, the obligations that have been assumed will be fulfilled.""
He added: ""It is obvious that the second part of the deal, which concerns us, has not yet been fulfilled ... The deal cannot stand on (only) one leg.""

Russia claims it is fighting in Ukraine to ""liberate"" Russian speakers in the eastern Donbas from what it has called a neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv.
Ukraine and the West say this is a baseless pretext put forward to justify a war of aggression and Moscow's attempts to seize swathes of Ukrainian land.

Moscow has blamed Kyiv for a breakdown in talks about a ceasefire, which stalled in the first weeks of the conflict. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said he will only consider peace settlements after Russian troops leave Ukrainian territory.

According to Ukrainian prosecution files seen by Reuters, the incidents were among a spree of sex crimes Russian soldiers of the 15th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade committed in four homes of Brovary district near the capital Kyiv in March 2022.
Russia's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Phone numbers listed for the brigade were out of order. Two officials at the Samara Garrison, of which the brigade is a part, said they were unable to give contacts for the unit when contacted by Reuters, with one saying they were classified.
During Moscow's failed push to capture Kyiv after its Feb. 24 invasion, soldiers entered Brovary a few days later, looting and using sexual violence as a deliberate tactic to terrorise the population, the Ukrainian prosecutors said.

""They singled out the women beforehand, coordinated their actions and their roles,"" said the prosecutors, whose 2022 documents were based on interviews with witnesses and survivors.
Most of the alleged atrocities took place on March 13, when soldiers ""in a state of alcoholic intoxication, broke into the yard of the house where a young family lived,"" the prosecutors alleged.
The father was beaten with a metal pot then forced to kneel while his wife was gang raped. One of the soldiers told the four-year-old girl he ""will make her a woman"" before she was abused, the documents said.
The family survived, though prosecutors said they are investigating additional crimes in the area including murders during the same period.
President Vladimir Putin's government, which says it is fighting Western-backed ""neo-Nazis"" in Ukraine, has repeatedly denied allegations of atrocities. It has also denied that its military commanders are aware of sexual violence by soldiers.
The soldiers were both snipers, aged 32 and 28, the files said, adding that the former had died while the younger, named as Yevgeniy Chernoknizhniy, returned to Russia.
When Reuters asked for the identities of both soldiers, prosecutors provided only the name of the younger man. When Reuters called a number in online databases for him, a person saying he was Chernoknizhniy’s brother said he was deceased.
""He died. There's no way you can get hold of him,"" said the man, crying. ""That's all that I can say.""
Reuters was unable to independently confirm his assertion.
The two snipers were among six suspects accused in the Brovary assaults, which prosecutors say is one of the most extensive investigations of sexual abuse since the invasion.
After the alleged attack on the girl and her parents, the two soldiers entered the house of an elderly couple next door, where they beat them, prosecutors said, also raping a 41-year-old pregnant woman and a 17-year-old girl.
At another location where several families lived, the soldiers forced everyone into the kitchen and gang raped a 15-year-old girl and her mother, they said.
All the victims survived, prosecutors said, and were receiving psychological and medical assistance.
A pre-trial investigation is ongoing into the possible role of superior officials in the Brovary attacks, prosecutors said, in a case adding to growing allegations of systematic sexual abuse by Russian soldiers.
Ukraine's Prosecutor General's office says it is investigating more than 71,000 reports of war crimes received since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops over the border.
Ukrainian investigators know the probability of finding and punishing suspects is low and potential trials would be mainly in absentia, but there are also international efforts to prosecute war crimes including by the International Criminal Court.
While suspects are unlikely to be surrendered by Moscow, anyone convicted in absentia may be placed on international watchlists, which would make it difficult to travel.
Russia has also accused Ukrainian forces of war crimes, including the execution of 10 prisoners of war.
A U.N. human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has said that most of the dozens of sexual violence accusations pointed at the Russian military.
So far, Ukrainian prosecutors have convicted 26 Russians of war crimes - some prisoners of war, some in absentia - of which one was for rape.

Europe,/world/europe/,Garbage piles up in Paris as Macron vows to push through pension reform,Forrest Crellin,2023-03-13 21:37:00+00:00,,"PARIS, March 10 (Reuters) - Garbage piled up in Paris streets and fuel deliveries were blocked from refineries as workers continued rolling strikes against pension reform but President Emmanuel Macron refused to meet with unions and said the reform must go ahead.
As debate about the reform continued in the Senate, workers blocked fuel deliveries from leaving TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) and Esso refineries on Friday, while power supply was disrupted and maintenance at some EDF (EDF.PA) nuclear reactors was delayed.
So far the impact has not been major, as cold weather has prevented the garbage in Paris and other cities from stinking, while there are no lines at gas stations yet as motorists and fuel station operators anticipated disruptions.
But the hardline CGT union at TotalEnergies' Donges refinery said the strike would continue at least until Thursday and garbage collector unions had set no date for a resumption of services.

In a letter to unions, Macron refused to agree to their request for a meeting, saying that unions had had ample time to negotiate with the government over the past months and that now was the time for parliament to review the reform, whose key measure is a two-year extension of the retirement age to 64.
""I do not underestimate the discontent that you express nor the fear of many French people that there will be no retirement for them,"" Macron said in the letter, published by French media.
He added that he would not compromise on the need to restore a durable financial equilibrium of the pension system in order to guarantee the pensions of future generations.

At the TotalEnergies refinery in Donges, western France, CGT union leader Fabien Prive Saint-Lanne blasted Macron for refusing to meet with the unions and said workers had decided to continue their strike at least until Thursday.
""The president refuses to meet with the unions ... his disdain for the world of labour can only sharpen people's anger and will either lead to violence in the streets or to revenge against Macron in the polling booth,"" he said.
Unions are planning more nationwide marches on Saturday. According to an interior ministry note cited by French TV BFM, police expect that 800,000 to one million people will demonstrate.
Opinion polls show a majority of voters oppose Macron's plan.
On Tuesday, 1.28 million people took to the streets in demonstrations across the country, the highest turnout in the sixth day of protest against the reform this year.
Fuel deliveries were also disrupted at the Fos refinery, operated by ExxonMobil (XOM.N) subsidiary Esso, a CGT spokesperson said.
Disruptions at liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals continued, with company Fluxys (FLUX.BR) saying that its Dunkirk terminal jetty and truck loading bay were unavailable and delivery capacity was reduced to a minimum.
Strike action also reduced French power generation by a 16.6 gigawatts (GW) - about 25% of current total power supply - at nuclear, thermal and hydropower plants, CGT said, but consumers felt little impact as state-owned utility EDF managed to compensate for the shortfall.

India,/world/india/,India's top court rejects govt plea seeking more compensation for Bhopal gas disaster victims,Arpan Chaturvedi,2023-03-14 06:56:00+00:00,,"NEW DELHI, March 14 (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the government's plea seeking more compensation from Union Carbide Corporation for victims of a gas leak in the central Indian city of Bhopal that resulted in one of the world's worst industrial disasters.
In the early hours of Dec. 3, 1984, methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide factory, owned by the American company, in the state capital of Madhya Pradesh. More than half a million people were poisoned that night and the official death toll exceeded 5,000.
Following the disaster, the government sued Union Carbide and the company agreed to pay an out-of-court settlement of $470 million in damages in 1989.
The government approached the country's top court in 2010 seeking enhanced compensation for the victims.
Dow Chemical, which now owns Union Carbide, denied liability, saying it bought the company a decade after Union Carbide settled its liabilities with the Indian government.

""We believe this would not be the appropriate course of action or method to impose a greater liability on the UCC (Union Carbide) than it initially agreed to bear,"" the five-judge bench said in its judgement dismissing the petition.
""We are equally dissatisfied with the Union of India for being unable to furnish any rationale for raking up this issue more than two decades after the incident.""
Built in 1969, the Union Carbide plant was seen as a symbol of industrialisation in India, generating thousands of jobs for the poor and, at the same time, manufacturing cheap pesticides for millions of farmers.
Thousands of survivors of the tragedy have said they, their children and grandchildren are still struggling with chronic health problems as a result of the leak and toxic waste left behind.

The case is being seen as a milestone event for LGBT rights in the country. India's top court decriminalised homosexuality in 2018 by scrapping a colonial-era ban on gay sex.
But the government said it opposes recognising same-sex marriage and urged the Supreme Court to reject challenges to the current legal framework lodged by LGBT couples.
""When the question of granting recognition, legal sanction to a relationship is concerned, that is essentially a function of the legislature and for more than one reason,"" India's Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, arguing on behalf of the government, told the court.

""The parliament will have to debate and take a call whether in the view of societal ethos and several other factors which go into lawmaking, whether we would like this institution to be recognised.""
In recent months at least 15 pleas, some by gay couples, have been filed asking the court to recognise same-sex marriages, setting the stage for a legal face-off with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
The issue of same-sex marriage is sensitive in India and speaking openly about homosexuality is taboo for many in the socially-conservative country of 1.4 billion people.
LGBT activists say that while the 2018 ruling affirmed their constitutional rights, it is unjust that they still lack legal backing for their unions, a basic right enjoyed by heterosexual married couples.
""We are of the considered view that it would be appropriate that the issues raised are resolved by a bench of five judges of this court,"" Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud said while dictating the order.

SVC, which has 198 branches across India, held total deposits of $2.23 billion in 2021-22. The statement said SVC has ""robust and strong fundamentals"".
Sachin Mane, branch manager at one of SVC's branches near India's financial capital Mumbai told Reuters on Monday the lender acted as there were rumours circulating on social media about the bank's financial health.

""There were a few queries from customers but it mostly came from social media rumours ... We wanted to communicate before lot of people started asking or before it became a big issue,"" said Mane.
""It's just confusion.""
California banking regulators shut down SVB on Friday after a run on the lender, which had $209 billion in assets at the end of 2022, with depositors pulling out as much as $42 billion on a single day, rendering it insolvent.
When one Twitter user asked SVC about ""rumours about bank default"", the Indian lender said ""You have got the Twitter handle wrong. We are SVC Bank ... one of the leading & strongest cooperative banks in India with a legacy of 116 years.""
There were no scenes of panic at two SVC branches in Mumbai suburbs that Reuters visited on Monday, with account holders carrying on usual banking activities.
One account holder showed Reuters a text message he received from SVC which asked them to not believe any rumours.
""SVC Co-operative Bank Ltd. has no relation with Silicon Valley Bank in California,"" it stated.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Moroccan palace asks Islamist party to stop criticizing ties with Israel,Reuters,2023-03-13 12:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5BKO2RJURZP2VERR7UTVU6KJNM.jpg,"RABAT, March 13 (Reuters) - Morocco's royal palace on Monday asked the largest Islamist party, the PJD, to stop taking aim at the country's ties with Israel after the party rebuked the foreign minister for defending Israel at the expense of Palestinians.
Renewed violence between Israelis and Palestinians poses a challenge to Arab countries that have normalised ties with Israel.
Morocco resumed diplomatic ties with Israel in late 2020 after a deal brokered by the Trump administration that also included Washington's recognition of Rabat's sovereignty over Western Sahara, a disputed territory where the Algeria-backed Polisario Front seeks to establish its own state.
""The general secretariat condemns the recent stand by the foreign minister in which he appears to be defending the zionist entity... at a time the Israeli occupation continues its criminal aggression against our Palestinian brothers,"" the PJD said in a statement last week.
The palace said that foreign policy was a prerogative of the King and it would not be ""subject to blackmail"".
Since the resumption of ties, Morocco and Israel have signed cooperation agreements, including a defence pact.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Saddam Hussein fell. Then violence in Iraq spiralled,Ahmed Rasheed,2023-03-14 06:05:00+00:00,,"BAGHDAD, March 14 (Reuters) - When U.S.-led forces toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, Adel Amer celebrated what he thought marked the end of two decades of war and isolation under sanctions that had brought Iraq and its people to their knees.
""I was dancing like crazy and couldn't believe Saddam was gone. I felt like a bird unleashed from a cage,"" Amer said.
But it turned out to be just the beginning of another era of conflict and chaos that saw an insurgency, the rise of Islamist violence and sectarian strife that deepened the suffering of Amer, now 63, and his family.
Amer's troubles began long before the U.S.-led invasion, which was launched on March 20, 2003. He had deserted from the army during Saddam's war with Iran in the 1980s.
""I was fed up with facing death all the time and seeing my friends either killed or maimed by heavy Iranian shelling all the time,"" Amer said.
He fought back tears as he spoke to Reuters and took out an old picture of him and his fellow soldiers when he was 20 inside a trench during the conflict, which claimed one million lives.
View 2 more stories 
""I told myself it’s time to flee the army. I was aware I would be executed if I was caught but staying alive was worthwhile and I did it. This is why I’m alive today,"" said the white-bearded Amer, who looked weak and tired after a lifetime of travails.
Amer fled his family house in a rural area near Baghdad airport to live in an orchard owned by his brother-in-law. He grew a long beard and worked as a farmer to avoid detection by Saddam's security forces.
He took another risk in 1990-1991, when Saddam's forces invaded neighbour Kuwait, a move that turned Iraq into a pariah.
A U.S.-led coalition hammered Iraqi forces and the United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq for more than a decade.
Amer avoided military service in Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait even after Saddam issued a decree that deserters would have part of their ear cut off or an X mark would be branded on their foreheads.
He was hated by his former army colleagues and most residents in his neighbourhood, although no one handed him in because they knew he would face execution.
""I suffered a lot and sometimes I was thinking of ending my life but told myself there is always a hope even if it was a little.""
When Saddam's long dictatorship ended in 2003, Amer threw an extravagant party in his house. He would never have to run for his life again now that U.S. troops had taken control of the country, so he thought.
U.S. President George W. Bush and his generals promised to deliver a thriving democracy and prosperous economy - a sharp contrast to Saddam's rule when innocent people were tortured and killed and billions of petrodollars were squandered.
Instead, more violence followed. Al Qaeda began a devastating insurgency, unleashing bombs and beheading people. Soon Iraq would be engulfed in a sectarian civil war in 2006-2008 mostly between Sunnis and Shi'ites. Corpses could be seen floating in rivers.
Amer and millions of other people would live in fear once again as Sunni militant groups and Shi'ite militias, many backed by regional powerhouse Iran, terrorised Iraqis and fought U.S. troops.
In October 2004, Sunni insurgents affiliated to Al Qaeda kidnapped Amer's father, brother and cousin from the family field while they were working and took them to an unknown destination only because they were Shi'ites.
""I was shocked and devastated fearing the worst will happen to my father, brother and my cousin. I was not ready to live in fear again,"" Amer said.
Amer spent around a year trying to determine if his relatives were dead or alive, often visiting the morgue in Baghdad where unknown bodies of those killed in communal violence were brought in.
""Around a year following the kidnapping of my father with a brother and a cousin, police came to my house and asked to go to the central morgue in Baghdad after they found the remains of three bodies dumped in a swamp not too far away from my area.""
Amer recalled how he went to the morgue in Baghdad and saw corpses stacked one above the other everywhere in the building.
""I knew one body from the watch that was still around the wrist bone. It was for my brother Kadhim,"" he said.
He took the bodies and buried them next day in the Shi'ite city of Najaf and set up a funeral tent right at the same spot he celebrated Saddam’s demise in 2003.
Amer went into hiding again. He rarely went out except to buy food for his wife and three daughters.
Life looked up eventually.
Amer found a job with a foreign construction company in 2010.
But more trouble came three years later. Amer was arrested by a militia close to Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al Haq and was beaten and dumped on a roadside with an arm, a rib and three teeth broken.
""They said I must not work for a U.S. company because this will make me just like a spy,"" he said.
""It was too tough for me to accept this situation. I told myself I didn't suffer a lot under Saddam’s regime to end up losing my family members to terrorists and then tortured and humiliated by my fellow Shi’ites only because I was dreaming of a better life.""
Amer quit his work fearing for his life and made up his mind to flee to Turkey in 2015. He paid $5,000 for a fake passport to flee to Europe via Greece but police in Athens airport caught him and jailed him for a week and then sent him back to Turkey.
""I was fed up with my country. It was hell for me to stay in Iraq and I decided to keep trying to migrate even if cost me my life,"" he said.
In 2016, Turkish police stopped a bus owned by a Turkish illegal migrant’s smuggler with 20 Iraqis including Amer on board trying to cross to Greece by boats. Amer said he was forced to return to Iraq a month later, where he now lives in fear that the Shi'ite group will hunt him down.
Amer said he is still determined to leave Iraq, two decades after U.S. troops and Iraqis pulled down a statue of Saddam Hussein in central Baghdad.
""I was in hiding under Saddam's regime, and now I'm in hiding again,"" he said. ""Before the invasion, there was just one Saddam. Today there are many more.""

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Polls show Erdogan lags opposition by more than 10 points ahead of May vote,Jonathan Spicer,2023-03-13 10:52:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/TCHURTR77NJ5XKPWBAWUMHJJMQ.jpg,"ANKARA, March 13 (Reuters) - New polls show the Turkish opposition's presidential candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leading against President Tayyip Erdogan by more than 10 percentage points ahead of elections on May 14 seen by many as the most consequential vote in Turkey's history.
The polls also show the opposition bloc, called the Nation Alliance, leading the parliamentary race, at least six points ahead of Erdogan's AK Party (AKP) and its allies. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) remains comfortably above 10%.
Erdogan faces the biggest challenge to his 20-year rule after the erosion of his popularity during a cost-of-living crisis. Victims of last month's earthquake are also reconsidering their loyalty in previous AKP strongholds.
The elections will decide not just who leads Turkey but how it is governed, where its economy is headed and what role it may play to ease conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Wolfango Piccoli, political risk advisory co-president at Teneo, said the Nation Alliance needs to present a unified front and sell the voters a plan to keep up their momentum heading into the elections.
""Simply blaming Erdogan for everything that is wrong in Turkey won't cut it. Past elections have shown that Erdogan is a phenomenal campaigner, but recent remarks suggest he has lost his popular touch and his ability to connect with voters,"" he told Reuters.
A poll published by Aksoy Research on Saturday and conducted on March 8 showed Kilicdaroglu, named as the opposition alliance candidate on March 6, leading against Erdogan with 55.6% support and 44.4%, respectively.
It showed the main opposition bloc garnering 44.1% of votes and the HDP at 10.3%. The AKP and its nationalist MHP allies earned 38.2% together.
A poll conducted on March 6-7 by Alf Research showed Kilicdaroglu at 55.1% and Erdogan on 44.9%. Kilicdaroglu's Republican People's Party (CHP) was the most popular with 31.8%, while the AK Party trailed with 31%.
The main opposition bloc earned 43.5% of votes, while the HDP got 11.3%, that poll showed. The AKP and the MHP together had 37.5% support.
Piar Research showed Kilicdaroglu winning with 57.1%, with Erdogan lagging on 42.9%. The CHP got 32.3%, the AKP 30.8% and the HDP 11.6%. The main opposition bloc got 46.4%, while the AKP and MHP earned 37.8%, the poll, published on March 10, showed.
ORC Research showed Kilicdaroglu ahead with 56.8% and Erdogan on 43.2%, according to a poll conducted on March 4-6, before Kilicdaroglu was officially announced as the opposition candidate.
The earthquakes appeared to have had little impact on the AKP's popularity. In a poll by Metropoll, 34.4% of people blamed the government for the losses during the earthquake, while 26.9% blamed contractors.
The municipalities came in third, with 15.4% of contributors saying they were to blame, while 12.9% answered with ""all.""
Merve Tahiroglu, Turkey programme director at the Washington-based Project on Middle East Democracy, said the opposition alliance was ""diverse"" and each prominent figure within the alliance could appeal to a different segment of Turkey.
""In this specific moment we have more reason to be optimistic about Turkey's election delivering an opposition win than we have ever been in the last 20 years,"" she said, speaking on a panel hosted by the Foundation for Defence of Democracies.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,"Turkey's quake toll tops 48,000 as government races to build container cities",Reuters,2023-03-13 12:11:00+00:00,,"ANKARA, March 13 (Reuters) - The death toll in Turkey from last month's major earthquakes has risen to 48,448, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Monday, as authorities rush to set up container cities to house for the longer-term those left homeless by the disaster.
The combined death toll including those killed in Syria has climbed to more than 54,000.
Speaking at a news conference in Malatya, one of the provinces hit by the quakes, Soylu said the toll in Turkey included 6,660 foreign nationals, mostly Syrians, adding that authorities were still trying to identify 1,615 victims.
The earthquake and subsequent powerful tremors injured more than 115,000 in Turkey and left millions sheltering in tents or seeking to move to other cities.
President Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to rebuild homes within a year but it will be many months before thousands can leave their tents or container housing, and daily queues for food, and move into permanent housing.
Soylu said the government plans to set up 115,585 containers for as many families in 239 sites across the affected region. He said 23 sites had been established so far and 21,000 containers were set up, with 85,000 people living in them.

He said 433,536 tents had been set up since the earthquake in 354 sites, adding that businesses would be given new temporary workplaces in the next 10 days.
During a visit on Sunday to Hatay, one of the worst-hit regions, Erdogan said Qatar had pledged to send 10,000 containers, which were used during the soccer World Cup at the end of last year.
Soylu said of the 36,257 buildings that collapsed, the rubble of 5,321 had been cleared, while 6,000 of 18,219 buildings slated for immediate demolition had been knocked down and the resulting rubble cleared.
He said the collapsed buildings and those slated for immediate demolition made up only 25% of the work, while other heavily damaged buildings that need to be demolished and cleared make up 75%.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,Jordan says S&P's stable outlook shows confidence in IMF-backed reforms,Suleiman Al-Khalidi,2023-03-14 09:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/34MQG3IH5JJV5IU6TO5EL4IF7A.jpg,"AMMAN, March 14 (Reuters) - Jordan's Finance Minister Mohamad Al Ississ told Reuters on Tuesday that S&P Global's decision to maintain the kingdom's sovereign credit rating at B+/B reflected confidence in accelerating IMF-backed reforms.
""This is the latest confirmation of Jordan's credit rating ... a collective validation across rating agencies in recent months in their confidence in Jordan's monetary and fiscal policy,"" Al Ississ said.
Ratings agency S&P noted in a report released late on Monday that Jordan was moving ahead with reforms aimed at enhancing investment, widening the tax base and targeting corruption, forecasting that fiscal imbalances will moderate in the coming years.
Several ratings agencies have in recent months either upgraded or affirmed the country's credit ratings, including Moody's which last November upgraded the kingdom's rating outlook to positive from stable.

Jordan’s commitment to IMF reforms and investor confidence in the outlook helped it to maintain stable sovereign ratings at a time when other emerging markets were being downgraded, Al Ississ said.
The IMF said at the end of last year that progress with structural reforms had cushioned the economy and strengthened macro-economic stability, boosting Jordan's growth in 2022 despite global economic turbulence.
Jordan's central bank governor Adel al Sharkas said the rating outlook reflected the ""soundness of Jordan's macroeconomic fundamentals"" at a time of global economic crisis.
""In light of the unfavorable environment, the move to categorize Jordan as a stable economy makes it an attractive destination for safe, long-term investments,"" he added.

Middle East,/world/middle-east/,"UN, Syrian government implicated in Syria aid failures after quake - commission",Emma Farge,2023-03-13 13:39:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/4VHVUMV3ZRJP5DOTUK7ULMH5FQ.jpg,"GENEVA, March 13 (Reuters) - The United Nations, the Syrian government and other actors are responsible for delays in getting emergency aid to Syrians after last month's earthquake, a U.N.-appointed commission of inquiry said on Monday, describing the failures as ""shocking"" and calling for a separate investigation.
The allegations add to a growing chorus of criticism of the global body for its role in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake that killed some 6,000 people in Syria, mostly in the rebel-held northwest near the Turkish border.
""Though there were many acts of heroism amid the suffering, we also witnessed a wholesale failure by the Government and the international community, including the United Nations, to rapidly direct life-saving support to Syrians in the most dire need,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the commission.
The parties involved also failed to agree on a pause in hostilities and to allow life-saving aid through any available route, leaving Syrians feeling ""abandoned and neglected by those supposed to protect them, in the most desperate of times,"" it said.

""The Syrian population has a right to the truth – why they received this treatment,"" Pinheiro added at a later press conference.
Of the delays in U.N. aid, another member of the three-person commission, Hanny Megally, told Reuters: ""You don't wait for permission to act in an emergency and that was what was shocking for us.""
Even when aid did begin flowing, days after the Feb. 6 quake, he said it was a backlog of food and other supplies and not the bulldozers and cranes needed to lift the debris or the medical equipment that could have treated the crush injuries of the rescued.
Syria's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA) spokesperson said 720 trucks loaded with aid has so far arrived in northwest Syria using three border crossings. He confirmed that no heavy equipment was sent in, saying this was the type of aid that only national authorities can provide.
Syria's government says humanitarian aid should go via territory under its control, although supplies to the northwest are allowed across the border from neighbouring Turkey under a U.N. Security Council agreement.
Last month's earthquake added to misery for people suffering from the consequences of 12 years of civil war, with more than 4 million people reliant on aid before it struck.
The independent commission was established to investigate violations by all parties to the conflict. Commission member Lynn Welchman also said on Monday that the body planned to follow-up on an Israeli air strike that knocked Aleppo airport of service, forcing aid flights to be rerouted.

TikTok has come under increasing focus over fears that user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, undermining Western security interests.
The United States, Canada, Belgium and the European Commission are among those that have already banned the app, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance Ltd, from government devices.
""Understanding exactly what the challenges that these apps pose and what they are asking for and how they're reaching into our lives is incredibly important,"" Tugendhat told Sky News when asked if he would like to see TikTok banned from British government phones.
""That's why I've asked the National Cyber Security Centre to look into this. I haven't yet had an answer. So I'm not going to give you that answer yet. I can't.""

In a separate interview with Times Radio, he said: ""We need to make sure that our phones are not spyware, but useful tools for us.""
TikTok said it would be disappointed by such a ban.
""Similar decisions elsewhere have been based on misplaced fears and seemingly driven by wider geopolitics, but we remain committed to working with the government to address any concerns,"" a TikTok spokesperson said, adding that it had begun taking steps to further protect European user data.
Last week, the White House backed legislation to give the administration new powers to ban TikTok and other foreign-based technologies if they pose national security threats.
Britain on Monday cast China as representing an ""epoch-defining challenge"" to the world order in an update to its blueprint for security and international policy.
Asked during a trip to the United States on Monday if the government was considering a ban on TikTok, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told ITV: ""We look at what our allies are doing.""
""We want to make sure that we protect the integrity and security of sensitive information. And we will always do that and take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that happens,"" he added.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,"'Downton Abbey' castle halts weddings due to Brexit, says owner",Sachin Ravikumar,2023-03-14 07:18:00+00:00,,"HIGHCLERE, England, March 14 (Reuters) - It is a problem the butler of ""Downton Abbey"" might have sympathised with.
Highclere Castle in southern England, where the early 20th century period drama about the lives of aristocrats and their servants was filmed, is facing a serious staffing crunch.
The reason is the dearth of workers from the European Union, which has forced owner Fiona Carnarvon to mothball the castle's main business of hosting larger weddings on the site of the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning show.
""We have stopped being able to offer any weddings of any substantial size because of Brexit,"" Carnarvon, a countess who owns Highclere with her husband, the eighth Earl of Carnarvon, said.
""There are no staff,"" she said, speaking from the morning room at the Victorian castle that sits on a 5,000-acre estate.
It used to host around 25 weddings with more than 100 guests a season. Weddings with around 20 guests are still possible, but are a much smaller part of a business that the owners say can cost several thousands of pounds a day to run.
View 2 more stories 
Revenues from other parts of Highclere's business such as its gift shop - the house opens to the public during the summer months - have also fallen, which Carnarvon says reflects not just Brexit but also the hit to the hospitality industry from COVID-19 and the cost-of-living crisis.
Its staffing challenges in particular illustrate the still-unfolding impacts of Brexit on Britain's labour market three years after the UK's departure from the European Union, its biggest trading partner.
A vital workforce of EU students attending university in Britain who were available to work during weddings is no longer available, said Carnarvon.
""When we go to our usual agencies and try to find people, they are not there,"" she said. ""If we asked for 10, three might turn up ... there's nobody we haven't asked.""
The number of EU students admitted to British universities fell 50% in 2021, and applications dropped 40%, partly due to uncertainty created by Brexit, university admissions service UCAS said last year.
Since leaving the European Union, Britain has faced worker shortages at various stages in areas such as manufacturing, construction and logistics.
With Britain still boasting higher rates of employment and lower unemployment than most EU countries, business groups have pushed the government to relax post-Brexit immigration rules.
Britain has relaxed the eligibility rules for work visas in a range of professions but the list does not include the hospitality sector.
Its Brexit-supporting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has also pushed back against calls from businesses to liberalise immigration to address labour shortages, saying withdrawal from the bloc had helped bring more flexibility on business regulation and secure ""proper control"" of the country's borders.
Just outside Highclere Castle, in the grounds designed by 18th century landscape architect Capability Brown, dozens of chairs and a few tables lie stacked and unused.
They will remain unused during the spring, too, as Highclere has closed afternoon teas it offered to the public, said Carnarvon, due to the lack of staff.
Highclere's gift shop has also stopped shipping to EU countries -- about a third of the shop's overall business -- because of increased courier costs and paperwork in the aftermath of the EU departure, Carnarvon said.
Other trade from the Highclere estate, such as the export of horse feeds, has also fallen due to high paperwork and legal fees, she added.
""We are wrapped in red tape now in every piece of our business,"" she said.
Weighed down by falling revenues and higher costs amid double-digit inflation, Highclere expects to just about break even this year, compared to profitable years prior to Brexit and the pandemic, Carnarvon said. Weddings made up 40% of the overall business at its height.
In some ways, the fortunes of Highclere Castle mirror the cutbacks to ""Downton Abbey"", which the show depicts as losing a number of staff over the years, especially as World War One depletes the influence of the English aristocracy.
But while weddings have declined, Carnarvon, is optimistic about new streams of revenue, such as a 35 pounds ($42) a bottle gin, which she says is gaining traction in the United States.
""It's beginning, its nascent, but it's a business which using our brand, can generate revenue to support us, hopefully, in the future,"" she said.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,"Russia and China threaten to create global 'danger and disorder', Britain says",Elizabeth Piper,2023-03-13 17:39:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZWSW2ZYKLFIGBPJARTUDISZIBI.jpg,"SAN DIEGO, March 13 (Reuters) - Britain cast China as representing an ""epoch-defining challenge"" to the world order in an update to its foreign policy framework and also said the United Kingdom's security hinged on the outcome of the Ukraine war.
The refresh of Britain's blueprint for security and international policy, published on Monday, warned of China’s deepening partnership with Russia and Moscow’s growing cooperation with Iran following the invasion of Ukraine.
The Integrated Review (IR) hardened the language and positioning towards Beijing and Moscow from the first edition two years ago.
But the decision to still not describe China as a threat was likely to disappoint many in Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservative Party, who also believe his pledge to spend an extra 5 billion pounds ($6 billion) on defence is insufficient to support Ukraine without leaving Britain vulnerable.

""What could not be fully foreseen in 2021 was the pace of the geopolitical change and the extent of its impact on the UK and our people,"" Sunak wrote in a foreword to the IR.
""Since then, Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, weaponisation of energy and food supplies and irresponsible nuclear rhetoric, combined with China’s more aggressive stance in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, are threatening to create a world defined by danger, disorder and division.""
The update was released as Sunak visited San Diego to agree the next steps in a defence agreement, AUKUS, with U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese
Of Britain's extra defence spending, 3 billion pounds will go towards nuclear projects, including help for Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time, part of efforts to counter China in the Indo-Pacific.
When it was first published in 2021, the Integrated Review described China as a ""systemic competitor"".
The updated document said: ""China under the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) poses an epoch-defining and systemicTchallenge with implications for almost every area of government policy and the everyday lives of British people.""
It also included a direct reference to Taiwan which had previously been absent.
""It has pursued rapid and opaque military modernisation with huge new investments, militarised disputed islands in the South China Sea, and refused to renounce the use of force to achieve its objectives with regard to Taiwan.""
While it outlined that Britain would step up its national security protections, the government said its preference was for better cooperation and understanding with Beijing, recognising its economic might.
""But we believe that this will depend on the choices China makes, and will be made harder if trends towards greater authoritarianism and assertiveness overseas continue,"" it said.
Among other measures, Britain has created a National Protective Security Authority, part of the MI5 intelligence agency, to help businesses and institutions to fend off state threats, especially from China.
While saying tensions in the Indo-Pacific ""could have global consequences greater than the conflict in Ukraine"", Britain said Russia still remained the most acute threat.
""What has changed is that our collective security now is intrinsically linked to the outcome of the conflict in Ukraine,"" the IR added.
Britain and other Western countries have increased their pledges of military aid for Ukraine this year, with promises of tanks and armoured vehicles as well as longer-range weapons.
On the other hand, they have expressed concern at support for Russia being potentially offered by China and Iran.
""China’s deepening partnership with Russia and Russia’s growing cooperation with Iran in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine are two developments of particular concern,"" the IR said.
With Sunak under pressure to do more to help the defence ministry combat inflation and replace weapons sent to Ukraine, two billion pounds will go towards replenishing and increasing conventional stockpiles and investing in munitions infrastructure.
""We're sliding towards a new Cold War. Threats are increasing. Yet here we are staying on a peacetime budget,"" Tobias Ellwood, Conservative lawmaker and Chair of the Defence Committee told parliament.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK's Hunt sets out English 'investment zones' ahead of budget,Reuters,2023-03-13 22:40:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PYP374UF6NJZZLISRIJQOLWLOQ.jpg,"MANCHESTER, England, March 13 (Reuters) - Britain's finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced on Monday he would create 12 ""investment zones"" in England to spur the regional economy outside London, a scaled-back version of a policy announced under former prime minister Liz Truss.

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK interior minister attacks 'naive do-gooders' amid criticism of small boats strategy,Andrew Macaskill,2023-03-13 20:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/6E2KSJ262VPVRKZXFZE4SXFPCY.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Britain's interior minister Suella Braverman defended her policy to remove almost all migrants who arrive without permission, saying her political opponents were ""naive do-gooders"" and there had has been ""too much"" immigration in recent years.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said that stopping asylum seekers arriving on the south coast of England in small vessels - often unseaworthy inflatable boats and dinghies - is one of his top priorities.
The legislation introduced to parliament on Monday aims to reduce the number of people entering Britain in that way, which last year reached a record 45,000, up 500% in the last two years. Many came from countries such as Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran and Iraq.
Under the government's plans, asylum seekers will be detained without bail before they are deported to their home country or, if this is not deemed safe, another safe third country.

Braverman, whose parents migrated to Britain in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius, said she had been the subject of ""grotesque slurs"" and would not be patronised on what appropriate views someone of her background could hold.
""I will not be hectored by out-of-touch lefties,"" she told parliament. ""It's perfectly respectable for a child of immigrants like me to say that I'm deeply grateful to live here, to say that immigration has been overwhelmingly good for the United Kingdom, but we've had too much of it in recent years.""
The Illegal Migration Bill is expected to be heavily contested in parliament and in the courts, setting up a clash over how to deal with the arrivals of small boats ahead of the next election expected next year.
As members of parliament debated the new law in the House of Parliament on Monday, hundreds of people gathered outside to protest against the legislation.
Only in limited circumstances, such as people who were considered too ill to fly or those at a ""real risk of serious and irreversible harm"", would people be allowed to claim asylum under the proposals.
Some lawmakers said in the debate they were concerned that the legislation that could allow the deportation of families, pregnant women, and torture victims.
Asked if she was satisfied if there was enough provision to protect vulnerable children, Braverman said she was comfortable with the levels of safeguarding.
""Let's be honest, the vast majority of arrivals - 74% in 2021 - were adult males under the age of 40,"" she said.
""The vast majority were not pregnant women, the vast majority were not young women. All travelled through safe countries like France, in which they could and should have first claimed asylum.""

United Kingdom,/world/uk/,UK doctors begin three-day strike in pay dispute,Reuters,2023-03-13 13:07:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Thousands of junior doctors in England walked out on Monday in three-day strike that will disrupt patient care, as they protest over pay they say can work out at less per hour than a barista.
The strike is the latest involving staff at Britain's state-funded National Health Service (NHS), following walkouts by nurses, paramedics and others demanding a pay rise that better reflects double-digit levels of inflation.
The NHS will prioritise emergency care during the strike, which could come at the cost of routine appointments, surgeries and even some urgent cancer treatments, NHS England National Medical Director Stephen Powis said.
""This is likely to be the most disruptive set of industrial action days that we've seen all winter,"" Powis told Times Radio.
""It is going to be a hard three days and it's going to be quite challenging.""

Junior doctors in Britain are qualified physicians, often with several years of experience.
The British Medical Association (BMA) trade union says starting pay for junior doctors can be as low as 14.09 pounds ($17.04) per hour, one pence less than the top level of pay for a barista at British coffee chain Pret A Manger.

Junior doctors agreed in 2019 to an annual 2% pay rise as part of a four-year deal but say that is now inadequate in light of much higher inflation. Last month, 98% of the nearly 37,000 who took part in the BMA's strike ballot voted in favour.
Robert Laurenson, co-chair of the BMA's Junior Doctors Committee, said they had seen a real terms pay cut over the last 15 years due to public sector wage freezes.
""We're just asking for that pay to be restored, and that looks like something like 19 pounds an hour,"" he told Reuters at a picket line in London.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure to help end walkouts by health workers, which also hinder one his major priorities of cutting long waiting lists for treatment.
Health minister Steve Barclay on Friday invited the BMA for formal pay talks.
""We stand ready to have those discussions, and urge them to come and engage with us,"" Barclay told reporters on Monday. ""I don't think a 35% pay demand is affordable.""
A broader wave of strikes in Britain, involving hundreds of thousands of public sector workers, comes at a time of pressured public finances and as Sunak's government prepares to deliver a budget on Wednesday.

United States,/world/us/,Hundreds of migrants try to force their way into US at Mexico border,Jose Luis Gonzalez,2023-03-13 15:33:00+00:00,,"CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico, March 12 (Reuters) - U.S. officials stopped hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants entering the country from Mexico on Sunday after a large group broke through Mexican lines to demand asylum in the U.S., only to be thwarted by barbed wire, barriers and shields.
Frustrated with problems securing appointments to seek asylum using a new U.S. government app, the migrants gathered at the frontier in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez, but could not breach the crossing connecting the two countries.
Many of the migrants had small children with them.
At one point, some migrants attempted to hurl an orange, plastic barrier at the U.S. line, Reuters images show. Some people said pepper spray was deployed to repel them.
""Please, we just want to get in so we can help our families,"" said Camila Paz, an 18-year-old Venezuelan, sobbing heavily. ""So I can have a future and help my family.""
Neither U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) nor the Mexican government's national migration authority immediately replied to requests for comment.

After some pushing and shoving with the officials, the crowd of migrants eventually withdrew, with some heading down to the banks of the Rio Grande where they were monitored by U.S. immigration officials arrayed on the other side.
Many migrants have become fed up with the asylum process since the Biden administration made an app called CBP One available to them that was meant to streamline applications.
They say the app is beset by persistent glitches and high demand, leaving them in limbo in perilous border regions.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said recent app updates will simplify and speed up the process.
Describing her situation as ""horrible, horrible,"" Paz said she had been trying to cross the border for a month, watching her money disappear and getting no nearer to claiming asylum.
""We want answers please,"" she said, ""the (CBP One) application has done absolutely nothing for us.""

Public opinion polls show DeSantis as the strongest threat to former President Donald Trump for their party's nomination for the 2024 presidential contest.
Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Monday posted on Twitter responses to a questionnaire from Republican candidates and possible hopefuls on the war in Ukraine.
""While the U.S. has many vital national interests ... becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,"" DeSantis said in his reply.
""The Biden administration’s virtual 'blank check' funding of this conflict for 'as long as it takes,' without any defined objectives or accountability, distracts from our country’s most pressing challenges,"" he said.

United States,/world/us/,Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen testifies before grand jury,Karen Freifeld,2023-03-13 23:10:00+00:00,,"March 13 (Reuters) - Michael Cohen, Donald Trump's former lawyer and fixer, testified on Monday afternoon before a Manhattan grand jury investigating a hush money payment he has said he orchestrated to porn star Stormy Daniels on behalf of the former president.
""This is all about accountability. He needs to be held accountable for his dirty deeds,"" Cohen said of Trump outside a Manhattan courthouse on his way to the grand jury.
Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, later said Cohen testified until 5 p.m. on Monday, after starting at 2 p.m. He said Cohen would return to answer more questions Wednesday afternoon.
The Manhattan District Attorney's office declined to comment. Grand jury proceedings are not public.
The renewed interest in Stormy Daniels and the $130,000 payment she received before the 2016 presidential election comes at a critical time for Trump, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. Daniels has said she got the payment in exchange for not discussing a sexual liaison with Trump, who denies it happened.

Trump has been given a chance to testify before the grand jury as a person subject to an investigation, Susan Necheles, an attorney for the former president, told Reuters last Thursday, a sign the grand jury may be close to deciding whether to bring criminal charges against him.
On Monday, Necheles said she had met with prosecutors earlier this month.

The Manhattan District Attorney ""now threatens to indict former President Trump for payments made to Stormy Daniels seven years ago,"" she said in a statement on Friday. ""For the DA's office to charge former President Trump, a victim of extortion, with a crime because his then lawyer, Michael Cohen, a convicted liar, paid the extortionist, would be unprecedented and outrageous selective prosecution.""
Cohen was sentenced to prison in 2018 in federal court in Manhattan for campaign finance violations tied to his arranging hush payments to Daniels and another woman during Trump's 2016 presidential run, among other crimes.
""This is not revenge,"" Cohen, who has become a Trump foe, told reporters on Monday. ""My goal is to tell the truth.""
Davis, his lawyer, would not comment on the details of Cohen's testimony before the grand jury on Monday. But, he added, ""I can say generally that Mr. Cohen sticks to the facts, and documents and materials that back up the facts. Any lawyer who deflects and engages in personal attacks must not have the facts on her side.""
It is doubtful that Trump, who has called the investigation a witch hunt, will agree to testify.
""I did absolutely nothing wrong. I never had an affair with Stormy Daniels,"" he said on his Truth Social platform last week.
Joseph Tacopina, another Trump lawyer, said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Monday there were no plans to participate in the grand jury, though a decision had not been made.
Necheles declined to comment to Reuters on whether Trump would testify.

United States,/world/us/,"California, Northeast menaced by late-season winter storms",Steve Gorman,2023-03-14 11:47:00+00:00,,"LOS ANGELES, March 13 (Reuters) - California, reeling from a month-long string of late-winter storms, braced for another bout of heavy rains, wind and snow on Monday, while most of New York state and New England girded for a powerful Nor'easter.
The leading edge of the latest Pacific storm swept into northern California and was expected to intensify late Monday night through Tuesday as it spread through central and southern parts of the state still sodden from weekend flooding.
Emergency crews preparing for the season's 11th ""atmospheric river,"" an airborne current laden with dense tropical moisture from the ocean, renewed sand-bagging operations and round-the-clock patrols of levees and rain-swollen riverbanks.
Mandatory evacuation orders remained in effect for residents in 10 California counties, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The National Weather Service (NWS) posted flood watches for much of the state, along with warnings for gale-force winds and extensive uprootings of trees.

""With the ground already saturated from the previous storm and river levels well above average, another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely"" along California's coast, the Sierra Nevada foothills and the state's vast Central Valley farm region, the NWS said.
Some of the heaviest rain, as much as 10 inches (25 cm), could fall in the Santa Barbara and San Bernardino mountains of Southern California, state climatologist Michael Anderson told reporters on Monday.
The rainfall was likely to hasten the melting of snow left on the ground from recent blizzards in mid-level mountain areas, adding to heavy runoff and flood hazards downstream, as it did over the weekend, forecasters said.
But the new storm was also expected to dump another 3 to 5 feet (1-1.5 meters) of snow at higher elevations, above 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), in the Sierra range, according to the NWS.
Anderson predicted additional precipitation from the looming storm, and one or two more still forming behind it in the Pacific, would likely push the southern Sierra snowpack to all-time historic levels, surpassing a 1969 record.

Nine atmospheric rivers lashed California in rapid succession from late December through mid-January, triggering widespread flooding, levee failures, mudslides and punishing surf. At least 20 people perished.
The 10th atmospheric river system of the season struck on Thursday and Friday, sending rivers and creeks spilling over their banks in several low-lying areas, most notably along central California's coast.
Drone footage above Monterey County showed entire neighborhoods inundated by muddy, brown waters after a levee on the Pajaro River failed. Evacuation warnings and orders across the county of 430,000 residents remained in place on Monday.
One evacuee from the flood-stricken community of Pajaro, farm worker Pedro Rangel, 42, attempted to return to his home on Monday but said he could not penetrate the mud and water surrounding his residence.
""It's sad for all of the people who live there. You lose everything,"" Rangel told Reuters at an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville.
About 140 miles (225 km) to the south, public works teams in San Luis Obispo County were monitoring stream levels and reinforcing a rain-weakened earthen levee along the Arroyo Grande Creek with sandbags in hopes of stemming renewed flooding.
""Now the creek levels are so high that it's really not going to take a lot to cause flooding,"" said Rachel Monte Dion, the county's emergency services coordinator.
Across the country, a Nor'easter storm was forecast to dump as much as 16 inches of heavy snow and whip winds of up to 45 miles per hour from Pennsylvania and New York state up into Maine starting on Monday night and into Wednesday, the NWS said.
Heavy, wet snow from the storm was likely to topple trees and power lines, causing power outages, while also diminishing visibility and making road travel extremely dangerous, forecasters said.

The leading edge of the latest Pacific storm swept into northern California and was expected to intensify late Monday night through Tuesday as it spread through central and southern parts of the state still sodden from weekend flooding.
Emergency crews preparing for the season's 11th ""atmospheric river,"" an airborne current laden with dense tropical moisture from the ocean, renewed sand-bagging operations and round-the-clock patrols of levees and rain-swollen riverbanks.
Mandatory evacuation orders remained in effect for residents in 10 California counties, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The National Weather Service (NWS) posted flood watches for much of the state, along with warnings for gale-force winds and extensive uprootings of trees.

""With the ground already saturated from the previous storm and river levels well above average, another round of major and life-threatening flooding is likely"" along California's coast, the Sierra Nevada foothills and the state's vast Central Valley farm region, the NWS said.
Some of the heaviest rain, as much as 10 inches (25 cm), could fall in the Santa Barbara and San Bernardino mountains of Southern California, state climatologist Michael Anderson told reporters on Monday.
The rainfall was likely to hasten the melting of snow left on the ground from recent blizzards in mid-level mountain areas, adding to heavy runoff and flood hazards downstream, as it did over the weekend, forecasters said.
But the new storm was also expected to dump another 3 to 5 feet (1-1.5 meters) of snow at higher elevations, above 8,000 feet (2,400 meters), in the Sierra range, according to the NWS.
Anderson predicted additional precipitation from the looming storm, and one or two more still forming behind it in the Pacific, would likely push the southern Sierra snowpack to all-time historic levels, surpassing a 1969 record.

Nine atmospheric rivers lashed California in rapid succession from late December through mid-January, triggering widespread flooding, levee failures, mudslides and punishing surf. At least 20 people perished.
The 10th atmospheric river system of the season struck on Thursday and Friday, sending rivers and creeks spilling over their banks in several low-lying areas, most notably along central California's coast.
Drone footage above Monterey County showed entire neighborhoods inundated by muddy, brown waters after a levee on the Pajaro River failed. Evacuation warnings and orders across the county of 430,000 residents remained in place on Monday.
One evacuee from the flood-stricken community of Pajaro, farm worker Pedro Rangel, 42, attempted to return to his home on Monday but said he could not penetrate the mud and water surrounding his residence.
""It's sad for all of the people who live there. You lose everything,"" Rangel told Reuters at an evacuation center in nearby Watsonville.
About 140 miles (225 km) to the south, public works teams in San Luis Obispo County were monitoring stream levels and reinforcing a rain-weakened earthen levee along the Arroyo Grande Creek with sandbags in hopes of stemming renewed flooding.
""Now the creek levels are so high that it's really not going to take a lot to cause flooding,"" said Rachel Monte Dion, the county's emergency services coordinator.
Across the country, a Nor'easter storm was forecast to dump as much as 16 inches of heavy snow and whip winds of up to 45 miles per hour from Pennsylvania and New York state up into Maine starting on Monday night and into Wednesday, the NWS said.
Heavy, wet snow from the storm was likely to topple trees and power lines, causing power outages, while also diminishing visibility and making road travel extremely dangerous, forecasters said.

United States,/world/us/,Texas judge sets hearing in case seeking to ban abortion pill nationwide,Brendan Pierson,2023-03-13 22:39:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MVRIRXTFSFJHRAI55ABKWOES5Y.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - A hearing in a lawsuit by anti-abortion groups seeking to ban the abortion pill mifepristone nationwide will take place on Wednesday, with media groups pressing the judge for greater transparency.
At Wednesday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo will consider whether to temporarily halt all sales of the drug, even in states where abortion remains legal, while their lawsuit proceeds.
Legal experts have said the Texas lawsuit could be the most significant national abortion case since the U.S. Supreme Court last year reversed its landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, which had guaranteed abortion rights nationwide. Mifepristone is part of the regimen in the U.S. for medication abortions, which account for more than half of all abortions in the country.
The Washington Post reported Saturday that Kacsmaryk had told lawyers in the case Friday that he intended to hold the hearing but would delay announcing it until Tuesday to avoid protests and disruptions.

Kacsmaryk's chambers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Following that report, the feminist organization Women's March said it was disturbing that the judge was trying ""to hide this case from public view"" and announced they would organize a ""snap protest"" Wednesday.
""Public access to federal court proceedings is a key principle of the American judiciary system,"" said Women's March Director Rachel O'Leary Carmona in a statement.
A group of media organizations filed an objection, saying the alleged delay by the judge was illegal and undermined ""the important values served by public access to judicial proceedings and court records.""
The organizations include the non-profit legal group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, the Washington Post and Gannett Co, which owns newspapers in Amarillo and elsewhere in the state.
Mifepristone, in combination with misoprostol, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for medication abortion in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.
Anti-abortion groups including the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine sued the FDA last November, claiming the agency used an improper process to approve mifepristone in 2000 and did not adequately consider its safety for minors.
The government, responding to the lawsuit, has said that the drug's approval was well supported by science, and that the challenge, 22 years after the fact, comes much too late. Major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have also weighed in to support the government, saying mifepristone ""has been thoroughly studied and is conclusively safe"" and that banning it would harm patients by delaying abortions and forcing them to have unnecessary surgical abortions.
Suing in Amarillo, where the Alliance had been incorporated three months earlier, ensured that the case would go before Kacsmaryk, a reliable conservative and former Christian activist. His courthouse has become a favored destination for Republicans seeking to challenge aspects of Democratic President Joe Biden's agenda.
He is also presiding over a pending lawsuit accusing media companies, including Reuters, of violating federal antitrust laws by working with tech companies to censor information about COVID-19. A Reuters spokesperson has denied the allegations.

United States,/world/us/,New York bike path attacker spared death penalty after jury deadlocks,Luc Cohen,2023-03-13 22:00:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Sayfullo Saipov, the man convicted of killing eight people in an attack on a Manhattan bike path in 2017, was spared the death penalty on Monday after a federal jury deadlocked on whether he should be executed.
As a result, Saipov will be sentenced to life in prison without parole. A unanimous decision had been required under federal law for a death sentence, which prosecutors had sought.
Saipov is expected to be housed at Colorado's Supermax facility, the most secure U.S. federal prison.
The 35-year-old Uzbek national had been convicted in January of murder with a goal of joining Islamic State, or ISIS, a group the United States designates a ""terrorist"" organization. His jury was reconvened to consider Saipov's punishment.
Saipov's case is the first federal death penalty trial since President Joe Biden, a Democrat, took office in 2021 after pledging during his campaign to abolish capital punishment.
View 2 more stories 
""In the end, Saipov's actions have highlighted one of the pillars of the rule of law in this country: the right to a full and fair public trial,"" Damian Williams, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, said in a statement after the verdict.
Saipov's lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
During the trial's penalty phase, jurors heard from survivors of the attack who testified about their ongoing suffering, and jail officers who described Saipov's outbursts and threats since his arrest.
""The defendant is still committed to jihad and ISIS and violence,"" prosecutor Amanda Houle said in her closing argument on March 7.
In its verdict form, read aloud by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick, the 12-person jury said it could not unanimously agree whether Saipov was likely to commit criminal acts of violence in prison.
Jurors agreed that other aggravating factors weighed in favor of the death penalty, including that Saipov planned his attack in advance and carried it out to support Islamic State.
They also agreed on several mitigating factors, including that many of Saipov's family members still loved him, and that a life sentence might give him time to realize what he did was wrong.
After the verdict was read, Saipov shook hands with David Patton, the federal public defender who represented him, before being led out of the courtroom by officers.
Patton said in his closing argument that the death penalty was ""not necessary to do justice.""
He said Saipov would spend 22 or 23 hours a day alone in a cell with a concrete bed if sentenced to life in prison.
""We can't rewind the clock and make it so that this senseless crime never happened,"" Patton said. ""We're asking you to decide that the right decision is life.""
Prosecutors sought the death penalty despite U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland's July 2021 moratorium on federal executions so the Department of Justice could review its use of the punishment.
Federal executions had resumed in 2020 under President Donald Trump, a Republican, after a 17-year hiatus. Thirteen were carried out before Trump left office in 2021.

United States,/world/us/,Top U.S. Republican McConnell to move to rehab after being released from hospital,Kanishka Singh,2023-03-13 22:05:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HJAFTWTVWBNY5NN47XHZ7AQCQA.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell was released from a hospital and will continue receiving treatment at a rehabilitation facility, his office said on Monday after one of Washington's most powerful figures suffered a fall last week.
McConnell's recovery from a concussion is proceeding well, his office said in a statement, adding that he also suffered a minor rib fracture in the fall. His continued treatment means McConnell will not be present when the Senate returns to Washington on Tuesday.
A senior Senate Republican aide suggested McConnell could be in rehab for up to two weeks.
""That decision (on a rehab timeline) will be made by the leader's physicians and the therapists. It is very common to undergo physical therapy to regain strength after a hospital stay, and this ranges anywhere from a week to two weeks,"" the aide told Reuters.
The Republican leader, who is 81 and was first elected to represent Kentucky in the Senate in 1984, tripped at a dinner event on Wednesday evening and was admitted to a hospital for treatment for a concussion. A former aide of the leader said on Friday that McConnell was eager to be discharged.
View 2 more stories 
His hospitalization came as Democratic President Joe Biden and Republicans, who control the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, remained locked in a standoff over the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling. A lack of progress in talks has raised concern about a possible default over the summer.
Several of his fellow Senate Republicans told reporters last week that McConnell was likely to be hospitalized for a few days but added they were confident he would be back on the job when the Senate reconvened this week.
As Senate minority leader, McConnell has taken a back seat to Biden and Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on the debt ceiling issue. But independent experts view the Kentucky Republican as a skilled negotiator who could broker a compromise deal in an emergency.
Currently serving his seventh six-year term, which runs through 2026, McConnell was the third U.S. senator to be hospitalized in recent weeks. Democrat John Fetterman is being treated for depression, while Democrat Dianne Feinstein was discharged to recuperate at home following a bout with shingles.
McConnell served as Senate majority leader from 2015 to 2021 and as Senate minority leader since then. Democrats, including three independents who vote with them, currently hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate, when all senators are present.
McConnell's legislative skills have torpedoed many Democratic initiatives over the years, both when his party held a majority in the chamber and when Democrats have held the edge, as they currently do.
He has long been criticized by Democrats, particularly for his tactics that allowed Republicans to build a 6-3 conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, including having the Senate refuse to consider a 2016 nomination to the high court by Democratic then-President Barack Obama.

United States,/world/us/,California court upholds treating app-based drivers as contractors,Daniel Wiessner,2023-03-14 01:07:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/KMDY3WEWVFP7LA547LU3PDUOQY.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - A California state appeals court on Monday revived a ballot measure allowing app-based services such as Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) and Lyft Inc LYFT.O> to treat drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, in a major victory for the industry.
A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based court reversed a lower court ruling in 2021 that the ballot measure, known as Proposition 22, was unconstitutional.
The appeals court ruling did strike down a provision of Prop 22 that limits the ability of gig workers to join unions, but the ruling was still broadly seen as a win for Uber and Lyft.
Shares of Uber and Lyft were up nearly 5% in after-hours trading.
The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and several gig drivers who challenged Prop 22 will likely appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court, the state's top court.
View 2 more stories 
Prop 22 was approved in November 2020 by nearly 60% of voters in California. It exempted app-based drivers from a 2019 state law known as AB5 that makes it difficult to classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees.
The issue is critical for gig companies because contractors do not receive the same legal protections as employees and can be up to 30% cheaper, according to several studies.
Prop 22 allows app-based transportation services to classify drivers as independent contractors as long as they are paid a minimum wage while transporting passengers and receive expense reimbursements and healthcare subsidies.
The 2021 ruling striking down Prop 22 found that it violated the state constitution because it limited the legislature's power to include gig drivers within the scope of California workers' compensation law.
The appeals court on Monday disagreed. The court, however, found that the provision of Prop 22 limiting the ability of gig workers to join unions and engage in collective bargaining was invalid and severed it from the rest of the ballot measure.
Uber's chief legal officer, Tony West, said in a statement that the ruling was a victory for gig workers and millions of Californians who voted in favor of Prop 22.
""Across the state, drivers and couriers have said they are happy with Prop 22, which affords them new benefits while preserving the unique flexibility of app-based work,"" West said.
But David Huerta, the president of SEIU California, said corporations should not be able to spend millions of dollars to ""buy themselves laws.""
""When gig companies can spend over $200 million to pass a law that violates our state’s constitution instead of investing in workers, it’s clear that California needs better safeguards for our democracy,"" Huerta said.

United States,/world/us/,"US VA to cover Eisai, Biogen Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi",Reuters,2023-03-14 11:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HIZOB4FB6VLHTEE65NLXI2BGVQ.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - Eisai Co Ltd and Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) said on Monday that the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) will provide coverage of their Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi to veterans at an early stage of the memory-robbing disease.
The VA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but a document on its website shows that the agency added Leqembi to its list nonformulary drugs, making it available provided patients request it, receive prior approval, and meet strict inclusion criteria for the drug's use.
The VA's coverage comes as initial patient access to the recently approved drug remains limited by a number of factors including reimbursement restrictions by the government's Medicare health program for Americans aged 65 and older, who represent some 90% of individuals likely to be eligible for Leqembi.
The companies set an initial annual price of about $26,500 for Leqembi.
The drug, known chemically as lecanemab, belongs to a class of antibody treatments designed to slow advance of the neurodegenerative disease by removing sticky clumps of the toxic protein beta amyloid from the brain.
View 2 more stories 
Leqembi has so far been approved in the U.S. under the Food and Drug Administration's accelerated review program. Medicare currently restricts drugs in its class approved under that pathway.
The treatment is currently undergoing the FDA's standard review process, which will weigh its impact on cognitive function.
Eisai and Biogen have said they expect full U.S. approval for Leqembi by summer or late this year, which would likely open up coverage by Medicare and other health insurers.

United States,/world/us/,New York scraps planned $2 bln light-rail train to LaGuardia airport,David Shepardson,2023-03-13 20:37:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/W2VJDWGDINL5RKROINVYGXCQTY.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - New York Governor Kathy Hochul said on Monday the state will scrap a planned light-rail train to connect the city's LaGuardia Airport after a study found the costs of the proposed train had jumped and instead proposed upgrading bus service.
Hochul put the AirTrain project on hold in late 2021 that her predecessor Andrew Cuomo had backed and estimated would cost $2.1 billion but is now forecast to cost at least $2.4 billion. She said she was grateful an expert panel provided ""a clear, cost-effective path forward with an emissions-free transit solution.""
The Port Authority plans to bring a planning authorization request to the board for approval in the next 60 to 90 days, to start the process to fund costs associated with improving bus service.
LaGuardia, the smallest of the New York City's three major airports, is the 25th busiest U.S. airport by passengers.
The panel said in a 450-page report the Port Authority should instead improve existing municipal bus service and add new non-stop airport shuttle service and dedicated bus lanes connecting to the end of a subway line in Queens rather than pay for new train service.
View 2 more stories 
The report estimated the AirTrain project would cost $2.4 billion and take six to seven years to complete, compared with just under $500 million in capital costs to expand bus service.
Riders Alliance praised the decision Monday, saying ""it's so refreshing to see government leaders admit a mistake and change course before it's too late.... Much better bus service is the right answer both for Queens riders and the travelers who pass through their neighborhoods on the way to the airport.""
Connecting the airport by subway would cost around $6.2 billion and estimated to take 12 years.
The panel said faced other hurdles including that it would run past the southern end of one LaGuardia runway. Experts were unable to determine the viability of underground tunneling that would comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations.

United States,/world/us/,Factbox: U.S. state abortion legislation to watch in 2023,Gabriella Borter,2023-03-07 23:09:00+00:00,,"March 7 (Reuters) - Battles over abortion are heating up in state capitols across the United States as lawmakers wrestle with how much to restrict or expand access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.
Here is a snapshot of state legislation seeking to restrict or protect abortion access in 2023.
FLORIDA: Republican lawmakers in Florida on Tuesday introduced a six-week abortion ban, which includes exceptions for rape and incest but does not make explicit exceptions for the life and health of the mother. Governor Ron DeSantis has said he would sign a six-week ban if passed by the state's Republican-dominated legislature. Meanwhile, a 15-week ban is in effect and is being challenged in court.
KANSAS: Although Kansans voted in favor of state abortion rights on a ballot measure last year, the Republican-led Senate has passed a prohibition on prescribing abortion pills via telemedicine. The House is considering the measure.
IDAHO: Lawmakers in Idaho have introduced legislation that would make it illegal to help a minor get an abortion in another state without the permission of a parent or guardian. Offenders would face two to five years in prison. The Republican-led state is currently enforcing a total abortion ban.
View 2 more stories 
MONTANA: The Republican-led state Senate has passed a bill seeking to overturn a 1999 state supreme court ruling that found that the state constitution protected a right to abortion. That ruling has prevented lawmakers in the conservative state from restricting abortion further than the current 24-week limit. The bill will next be considered by the House.
The House on Friday passed legislation seeking to ban abortion after 12 weeks and is also considering a bill this year that would limit abortion access for Medicaid patients.
NEBRASKA: Republicans in Nebraska's 50-seat unicameral legislature have introduced a six-week abortion ban, which looks likely to pass due to the conservative makeup of its members. Abortion is currently legal in the state up to 22 weeks.
NORTH DAKOTA: The state supreme court is due to rule on a challenge to a trigger ban - a total abortion ban that immediately went into effect when Roe was overturned - but which has since been blocked while the case proceeds. In the meantime, Republican lawmakers are moving a bill to allow abortions for rape and incest cases before six weeks' gestation, intending to clarify the ban.
SOUTH CAROLINA: Despite the fact that the state supreme court recently struck down a six-week abortion ban in a 3-2 vote, Republicans have introduced a near-total abortion ban and a six-week ban this year. Both bills have passed one chamber; the Senate has passed the six-week ban, which includes some exceptions, and the House has passed the near-total ban.
TEXAS: While abortion is completely banned with very limited exceptions in Texas, Republican state representatives have introduced legislation that would compel internet providers to block websites that supply abortion pills or provide information on how to obtain an abortion.
UTAH: The legislature passed a bill this month that would prohibit the licensing of abortion clinics, which abortion rights advocates say would effectively eliminate access in the state. The measure now heads to Republican Governor Spencer Cox for signing. Abortion is currently banned after 18 weeks in the state.
WYOMING: The Republican-led legislature passed a bill this month banning the use or prescription of medication abortion pills, and the bill now heads to Republican Governor Mark Gordon. Abortion is legal until viability, about 24 weeks, while a state court is reviewing a challenge to a near-total trigger ban.
WEST VIRGINIA: Republican state senators have introduced a bill to remove the rape and incest exceptions from the state's near-total abortion ban, which is currently in effect.
MICHIGAN: The Democratic-led House has passed a bill to repeal a nearly century-old law on the books that bans abortion. It is expected to also pass the Democratic-led Senate.
ILLINOIS: Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker in January signed a law protecting abortion providers and out-of-state patients from legal attacks waged by other states.
MINNESOTA: Democratic Governor Tim Walz in January signed legislation passed by the Minnesota legislature's new Democratic majority that codifies abortion rights in state law, as well as a right to contraception and fertility treatment. House Democrats have introduced a bill to shield abortion providers and patients from other states' legal attacks.
OHIO: The attorney general this month certified a petition to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2023 ballot that would assert a right to abortion. The ballot proposal next heads to the Ohio Ballot Board for consideration.

United States,/world/us/,U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks stock up on cash amid 'heightened demand',Reuters,2023-03-13 21:04:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ONTXMHL2ANPUXHQWGECJEZI474.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks beefed up their lending warchests on Monday to provide more liquidity to banks amid continued higher-than-usual demand for funds as the fallout from the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank reverberates through medium- and smaller-size financial institutions.
The FHL Bank system raised $88.73 billion by selling short-term notes with maturities from three months to one year on Monday afternoon, according to Informa Global Markets, a provider of syndicated bond data. The offering was raised from an initial $64 billion due to high demand.
The 11 FHL Banks, regional government-chartered institutions that raise money for low-cost lending to their members, are a vital source of funding to regional banks, often a preferred final stop for cash before banks in need turn to the Federal Reserve itself as a last resort.
Their largely behind-the-scenes role has surfaced more prominently since back-to-back bank collapses raised concerns about wider financial stability. On Monday, as financial stocks took a pounding in the aftermath of federal regulators having to step in to keep depositors at SVB and Signature whole, a number of banks touted their credit positions with the home loan banks as evidence of their soundness.

""As members react to a volatile market and seek stable funding, the Federal Home Loan Banks collectively continue to see heightened demand for our advances. Consistent with our statutory and foundational mission to provide liquidity to our members, the FHLBanks are prepared and well-positioned to continue to address our members' needs,"" Ryan Donovan, president and CEO of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, said in a statement.
The FHL banks are seen as a preferred mechanism because they can be tapped for short-term funding by commercial banks without the taint associated with using the Federal Reserve's own safety net backstop known as the discount window.
It was unclear if the new backstop rolled out by the Fed on Sunday - the Bank Term Funding Program - would draw business away from the FHL banks, but so far that does not appear to be the case.
Advances to members have spiked during other periods of severe market stress in order to stabilize liquidity, most notably at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis and in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Indeed, they became an ever-more-important source of liquidity for banks in the last year as the Fed lifted interest rates by 4.5 percentage points, putting pressure on their investment portfolios and deposit bases. Credit extended to commercial banks by the FHL banks more than doubled last year to more than $800 billion by year end.
""The Federal Home Loan Bank System is strong, stable and stands ready to serve our members,"" Donovan added.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Boeing expected to sell nearly 80 787 planes to Saudi airlines -source,David Shepardson,2023-03-13 21:25:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) is expected to sell nearly 80 787 Dreamliner airplanes to two Saudi Arabian airlines, a source briefed on the matter said on Monday.
An announcement of the plan reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal is expected as soon as Tuesday, and the list prices for 78 planes would total nearly $37 billion. Airlines typically get undisclosed discounts when buying airplanes.
State-owned Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) and new national airline Riyadh Air will both be acquiring Boeing 787s, the source said. The airlines are expected to buy a total of 78 787s split between the two buyers and have options to buy another 43, the source said.
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman formally announced on Sunday the creation of Riyadh Air, with industry veteran Tony Douglas as chief executive, as the kingdom moves to compete with regional transport and travel hubs.
Riyadh Air will serve more than 100 destinations around the world by 2030, making use of the kingdom's location between Asia, Africa and Europe, state news agency SPA said.

The new airline is expected to add $20 billion to Saudi Arabia's non-oil GDP growth and create more than 200,000 jobs both directly and indirectly, it said.
Riyadh Air is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, which has more than $600 billion in assets and is spearheading the kingdom's efforts to diversify its economy and wean itself off oil.
In October, Saudi Arabia was in advanced negotiations to order almost 40 A350 jets from Airbus (AIR.PA), while Boeing was also lobbying for a slice of the kingdom's transportation expansion, industry sources had told Reuters.
The Saudi deal comes on the heels of a major December order from United Airlines (UAL.O) for 100 787 Dreamliners and 100 737 MAX jets.
Earlier this month, Reuters exclusively reported that Indian budget carrier IndiGo is in talks with Boeing and Airbus to purchase more than 500 aircraft, an order that had been expanded to include widebody planes such as the 787 or Airbus A330neo.
On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would allow Boeing to resume deliveries of the 787 this week that had been temporarily suspended since February.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,"Aircraft lessors, insurers jostle in UK court over stranded jets in Russia",Kirstin Ridley,2023-03-13 15:22:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/47OKR2CPCJMY3KFTUPYP25AGM4.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - AerCap (AER.N), the world's biggest aircraft lessor, said on Monday it was inconceivable that it would not recover some losses from insurers over jets stranded in Russia, as lessors took their battle for redress to London's High Court.
More than 400 aircraft, worth almost $10 billion, have been stuck in Russia after Western countries slapped sanctions on the country over the year-old war in Ukraine - and Russian aircraft lessees did not return the jets.
Insurers are balking at payouts, alleging in part that there has not been a physical loss of the planes yet, that the jets and engines are no longer subject to a lease agreement and that Western sanctions prevent them from providing cover.
Dublin-based AerCap said it was out of pocket to a ""colossal"" degree and, along with at least four peers, has lodged a lawsuit that hinges on whether the alleged loss of the aircraft has triggered war-risk insurance policies, which have payout limits, or uncapped all-risk policies.
View 2 more stories 
AerCap, the largest claimant, is suing insurers such as AIG (AIG.N) and Lloyd's Insurance Company for $3.5 billion over the loss of 116 aircraft and 23 engines under its all-risks insurance policy. Alternatively, it is claiming $1.2 billion under its war-risks policy, court filings show.
""... in the real world, it is inconceivable that we do not recover under one,"" Mark Howard, a lawyer for AerCap, told the first day of a preliminary High Court hearing.
AerCap, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise (DAE), Merx Aviation, KDAC Aviation Finance and Falcon allege they terminated Russian leasing contracts in line with sanctions and demanded in vain for the return of aircraft and engines, court documents show.
DAE and Falcon are suing 11 insurers, including Lloyd's of London [RIC:RIC:SOLYD.UL], AIG, Chubb (CB.BN) and Swiss Re (SRENH.S) over 21 aircraft and equipment valued at $900 million under all-risks policies, or for just under $800 million under war-risks policy limits.
Merx is claiming more than $255 million over the alleged loss of six aircraft, and their engines and records, while KDAC is suing for $21.5 million over the loss of one jet, court filings show.
Judge Christopher Butcher said on Monday that the five lessors' cases should be heard together - though the inclusion of Merx and KDAC will remain under review - in what AerCap's lawyers described as a ""mega trial"", which is expected to begin in October 2024.
Gavin Kealey, a lawyer for AIG, noted that a senior DAE executive had been told by a Russian lessee that it had been instructed by the Kremlin not to return any aircraft and not to cooperate with ""unfriendly lessors"".
He called for a ""detailed expert investigation"" to establish how power is exercised in Russia.
Moscow has condemned the sanctions and allowed its airlines to place the aircraft on its national registry, sparking a row over whether planes can be registered in two places at once.

Aerospace & Defense,/business/aerospace-defense/,Spain may cancel remaining Airbus A400M orders -sources,Belén Carreño,2023-03-13 22:41:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VBP2SVT5PBKD5ERJ74PAQBMAYU.jpg,"MADRID/PARIS, March 13 (Reuters) - Doubts are growing over the future of Madrid's remaining orders for the Airbus (AIR.PA) A400M airlifter, European defence sources said on Monday, raising the stakes of talks over the planemaker's future investment in one of its founder nations.
The A400M is one of Europe's core defence projects and a focal point for aerospace investment in Spain, which has ordered 27 of the troop planes and is responsible for final assembly.
But after several months of uncertainty, European defence sources said Madrid was leaning towards cancelling the remaining 13 or so aircraft in Spain's quota that have not been delivered, after its air force indicated it did not need the extra planes.
The Spanish government and Airbus declined comment.
Designed to boost the strategic autonomy of seven European NATO nations that previously relied on U.S. airlift, the A400M project has been hit by a series of cost overruns and delays.

Fresh doubts over what was once Europe's largest defence project emerged as Airbus (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Guillaume Faury attended centenary celebrations of Construcciones Aeronauticas (CASA), one of the European companies that gave birth to Airbus more than 50 years ago.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Defence Minister Margarita Robles and King Felipe also attended Monday's event in Getafe, outside Madrid, which included the opening of a space facility.
Any decision over the future of the A400M is expected to trigger intense negotiations over alternative defence orders and Airbus's ongoing investment in Spain, the sources said.
Spain and Airbus are already in discussions over how to soften any impact from a partial A400M order cancellation, they said, while Sanchez's office issued a detailed breakdown of the benefits that Spain had provided Airbus.
In a statement following a meeting between Sanchez and Faury on Monday, the prime minister's office made no mention of the A400M but urged Airbus to increase its footprint in Spain - one of its core nations alongside France, Germany and Britain.
The two sides ""addressed the need for the company to increase the industrial workload in Spain"" as well as boost research spending and space activities, the statement said, adding that Madrid had supported Airbus during the pandemic.
There was no immediate comment on the meeting from Airbus.
Defence publication Janes reported last year that Airbus was waiting for Madrid to back the SIRTAP tactical drone project, co-developed by Airbus Spain and Colombia.
Spain also last year ordered an extra 20 Eurofighter combat jets, a four-nation fighter programme for which Airbus is the industrial partner in Spain and Germany.
Spain's unemployment rate rose to 12.87% in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 12.67% three months earlier, pushing the number of unemployed people above the 3 million threshold.
In the southern Spanish region of Andalusia, where Airbus assembles the A400M, the rate was however higher at 19%.

Autos & Transportation,/business/autos-transportation/,Exclusive: Nissan's electric comeback stalled by Ariya production woes,Norihiko Shirouzu,2023-03-10 16:50:00+00:00,,"TOKYO, March 10 (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co's (7201.T) new Ariya electric vehicle has been hampered by problems at its high-tech production line, four people familiar with the matter said, slowing delivery of a car designed to put the automaker on the road to a comeback.
Unveiled in 2020 to strong reviews, the crossover was Nissan's first all-new global car in five years and signalled an intent to turn the corner on the turmoil that followed the ouster of former head Carlos Ghosn.
But production is running at least a third below plan, keeping the Ariya from shipping to new customers, according to three of the people and production planning notes reviewed by Reuters. All of the people declined to be identified because the matter is private.
The shortfall represents a lost opportunity to capitalise on the Ariya's buzz and test demand for the first of 19 new EVs Nissan plans to roll out by 2030. It also hinders the automaker's plans for growth in the electric car market it helped pioneer before ceding dominance to Tesla Inc (TSLA.O).
View 2 more stories 
Ariya production has been slowed by problems with the highly automated ""intelligent factory"" manufacturing system it built for the model at its plant in Tochigi, north of Tokyo, two of the people said.
Nissan designed a system that would allow it to produce cars with different powertrains - batteries, hybrids and internal combustion engines - on the same line.
Implementation has proved ""an extremely, extremely high challenge"" and the advanced paint line has become a persistent headache, one of the people said.
Nissan also faces shortages of plating for an electronic component for the Ariya after a fire at China-based supplier Wuxi Welnew Micro-Electronic in January, one of the people said. The supplier told Reuters it had shifted output to a second plant and was ""working to recover production.""
In a statement to Reuters, Nissan said Ariya production had faced challenges including supply of semiconductors, disruptions in components shipments and the factory's paint line. ""Nissan is making a full and diligent effort to fully regain production capacity at the plant,"" the company said.
S&P Global Ratings this week cut Nissan's debt rating to junk status, saying margins and sales volumes were unlikely to improve as quickly as previously expected.
The production challenges come as Nissan and France's Renault SA (RENA.PA) in January agreed to overhaul their two-decade-old alliance on more equal footing. Nissan also agreed to invest in Renault's new EV business.
The Japanese automaker rode a wave of early interest in EVs with the Leaf hatchback in 2010. But by 2020 that car was overtaken by Tesla's Model 3 in terms of lifetime sales. EVs accounted for just 4.5% of Nissan's global sales of 3.2 million vehicles in 2022.
Nissan has targeted production of 400 Ariyas a day, according to two of the people, equivalent to almost 9,000 vehicles a month and more than 100,000 a year.
Output over the next two months is expected to fall short of that, according to production planning notes from last month reviewed by Reuters. Output in March was forecast at under 6,900 vehicles and at around 5,200 in April and 5,400 in May, according to the planning notes. That has since been lowered, one of the people said.
Nissan did not comment on production targets or current output.
U.S. dealers stopped taking customer reservations last year, while Japanese dealers stopped taking orders in August.
The Ariya was supposed to hit showrooms in 2021, but that was pushed back to 2022 because of a global chip shortage.
Dublin Nissan in northern California has one Ariya for test drives, but it is not for sale, said general manager Mario Beltran. The dealership is waiting for more that could arrive this spring, he said.
""Just like the Beetle brought Volkswagen back, I think the Ariya will bring Nissan back,"" Beltran said, adding some customers had cancelled Tesla deposits for the Ariya.
The car has won praise for a bold exterior and a sleek interior with lights inspired by Japanese lanterns.
With a starting price of about $43,000 in the United States, the Ariya is an alternative to Tesla's Model Y, which costs about $4,300 more after recent price cuts and U.S. incentives. The Ariya qualifies for a U.S. credit of $7,500 paid to Nissan's finance company when leased.
The Ariya line was built with an initial investment of 33 billion yen ($243 million) as part of the ""intelligent factory"" initiative that Nissan says represents a completely new production system with robotics and a zero-emission pledge.
The new paint line was designed to paint an entire car, including body and bumpers, together, to boost efficiency and be more environmentally friendly.
Nissan has also invested in a new assembly technique that allows different powertrains to be lifted from underneath before robotic installation, saving time.
The new system uses an automated pallet to mount a pre-assembled powertrain.

The announcement comes as layoffs by U.S. companies in the past two months touch their highest since 2009, with the tech sector accounting for more than a third of the over 180,000 job cuts announced.
The largest U.S. automaker in January disclosed a $2 billion cost cut target, including reducing employment through attrition.
Under the terms of the staff reduction plan, all U.S. salaried employees with at least five years of service and all global executives with at least two years of service will be offered lump sum payments and other compensation to exit the company, GM said.
GM CEO Mary Barra said in a memo to employees seen by Reuters that the automaker was outlining the ""biggest opportunities to reduce our structural cost"" including reducing ""vehicle complexity and expanding the use of shared subsystems between existing internal combustion engine and future electric vehicle programs.""

She also cited decreasing discretionary spending and ""reducing salaried staff through attrition, primarily in the United States.""
""By permanently bringing down structured costs, we can improve vehicle profitability and remain nimble in an increasingly competitive market,"" Barra wrote. ""Now more than ever, we need to have a mindset of taking cost in everything we do. It needs to be built into our culture.""
GM expects to take the bulk of the charge in the first half of 2023.
GM, whose shares fell 4.3%, had 58,000 salaried employees at the end of 2022.
Eligible employees interested in the voluntary program must sign up by March 24 and those agreeing will leave GM by June 30. Barra added ""taking this step now will help avoid the potential for involuntary actions.""
The buyouts are separate from job cuts the company made last month.
A GM executive in February said the company was cutting hundreds of executive-level and salaried jobs. Peer Ford Motor Co (F.N) said it planned to eliminate 3,800 product development and administration jobs in Europe in the next three years.

Environment,/business/environment/,"CERAWEEK-US clean energy 'carrots' could put Europe behind in decarbonization race, execs say",Ron Bousso,2023-03-09 16:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/B5AXSXRDPRJ5HKU56M2BG7J4AY.jpg,"HOUSTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Billions of dollars in clean energy incentives are poised to speed investment on American soil while putting the European Union's energy transition at risk by luring away money and talent, executives at the CERAWeek energy conference said this week.
U.S. President Joe Biden's landmark Inflation Reduction Act climate package was signed into law last year and has caused trade tensions between Washington and allies competing for cash and skilled labor to advance a shift from fossil fuels and combat climate change.
Europe can ill afford to see a slowing in the energy transition as the continent struggles with soaring gas and power prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The IRA directed some $370 billion in tax benefits to U.S. development of solar, wind, geothermal and other renewable energy technologies, as well as to electric vehicles and projects that reduce or capture industrial greenhouse gas emissions before they reach the atmosphere.

On Wednesday, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the Biden administration makes no apologies for the IRA, and challenged EU allies to follow the U.S. lead by providing more subsidies of their own.
""We don't want to stoke trade wars or anything like that,"" said Granholm. ""We keep saying 'have at it - you should do the same thing' - a little friendly competition is all.""
""But we are serious about bringing supply chains back into this country,"" she said.
She called the U.S. incentives ""10 years of IRA carrots you can take to the bank"" and said more than 100 companies in the electric vehicle supply chain had announced investments in the United States since the law passed.
European energy companies echoed the call for Europe to come up with its own new incentives.
""It would be great to see the European Union policy move from stick to carrot,"" said Josu Jon Imaz, chief executive officer of Spanish energy provider Repsol SA (REP.MC). ""We don't need banning technologies, we don't need restrictions, we need to be attractive.""
Repsol this year expects to spend almost 40% of its project budget in the United States, including $1.5 billion in oil and gas and $1 billion in renewables, compared with 25% going into the Iberian peninsula, Imaz told Reuters.
""Simplicity is from my point of view one of the main features of the IRA and that is very important for investors... you have a broad possibility to invest in many areas in the United States,"" he said.
Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of French energy giant TotalEnergies told the conference the IRA was an ""invitation to accelerate green infrastructure.""
""Fundamentally, you see it as an opportunity when you put incentives. In Europe, you begin to regulate,"" he said, adding that Europe and the United States should consider forming a free trade agreement on renewable energy infrastructure.
""We like the IRA,"" said Sanjiv Lamba, CEO of hydrogen producer Linde Plc. It is simpler and easier to understand than the EU's lengthy policy statements, he said.
Takajiro Ishikawa, chief executive of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Americas, also said the IRA is an investment magnet.
""All of the capital from advanced countries and even developing countries is flooding to America to take part of the investment that stems from the IRA,"" Ishikawa said
He cited a direct pay component of the Act, which allows foreign entities to benefit directly from its incentives.
""You have Uncle Sam paying you for that tax incentive... it's earth-shattering,"" said Ishikawa, whose firm is involved in hydrogen development and carbon capture and sequestration.
Ken Gilmartin, CEO of British engineering firm Wood Plc, said the IRA would put the United States in first place in the decarbonization race.
""That is not a sentence I thought would say five years ago,"" he said, noting that former President Donald Trump had withdrawn the U.S. from global efforts to fight climate change.
U.S. executives offered more tempered enthusiasm for the incentives, saying permitting obstacles can add years to development of pipelines or carbon sequestration sites.
White House energy adviser John Podesta said during the week that the Biden administration was working to reduce complexity and timelines for permitting and hoped the U.S. Congress could pass comprehensive reform of the process.

Environment,/business/environment/,Column: The ironic side effects of the rapid global energy transition,Gavin Maguire,2023-03-10 17:53:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/A47P2MHNTRPMLEV34EYC3NE72E.jpg,"LITTLETON, Colorado, March 9 (Reuters) - There's a consensus among some climate advocates that catastrophic global environmental damage can only be avoided by a rapid and comprehensive retooling of the world's energy system and tough caps on emissions for industry.
That view is shared by growing numbers of civilians, businesses and governments as worsening droughts, floods, wildfires and heat waves shore up backing for urgent action to slash pollution and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
This chorus of support for the energy transition has ignited an almost frantic renewable energy development spree across the world, with green energy generation capacity growing at a record pace in every major economy.
For all the good intentions, though, the great green energy revolution has had its share of growing pains, including some rather surprising unintended consequences that in some cases may have caused more environmental harm than good.

One example of a surprising side effect of emissions-cutting policy has been the surge in northern hemisphere water temperatures since strict new pollution regulations came into effect three years ago.
On January 1st, 2020, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) implemented ship emissions standards that slashed the maximum level of sulfur allowed in shipping fuels.
Known as IMO2020, the new rules were aimed at reducing air pollution spewing from the global shipping fleet, with an IMO study claiming that 570,000 premature deaths would be prevented globally between 2020 and 2025 by the cleaner-burning fuel.
The resulting sharp drop in sulphate particles in the atmosphere, however, caused a surge in solar radiation absorbed by the oceans along the world's busiest shipping routes, according to a study by climate researcher Leon Simons.
According to Simons, a board member of the Club of Rome - a nonprofit group of intellectuals and business leaders that discusses major global issues - the previously higher levels of sulfur particles had helped reflect some solar radiation. As sulfur levels dropped more radiation was absorbed.
That helped to raise ocean temperatures, with sea surfaces in the northern hemisphere in 2022 averaging 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the average from 1979-2000.
""If this trend continues that could mean that the Northern Hemisphere mid latitudes (where many of us live) will warm much more rapidly,"" Simons said in a recent Twitter post.
Another ironic side effect of the rush into renewable energy has been the build up in components that have reached the end of their useful life but are hard to recycle.
An obvious example is wind turbine blades, which have a design life of roughly 20 years before they need to be replaced due to worn parts or because they are far less efficient than newer blades.
As each blade can stretch more than 100 feet (30.5 m) and weigh over 2 tonnes, the upgrading of entire wind farms can cause headaches for developers, who sometimes resort to burying old blades in landfills.
Some firms are developing blade recycling capabilities, such as Carbon Rivers, LM Wind Power and Veolia (.VIA.PA), but tend to steer clear of the earliest generation of wind blades, which were made from hard-to-process composite materials.
Old solar panels face a similar predicament, especially ones that lack the efficiency of newer models and in the eyes of resellers are not worth collecting from old sites and homes.
Again, there are a growing number of firms that do recycle old panels, but, like wind blade recyclers, they can struggle to economically procure enough stock of discarded components to make operations profitable. They can also face volatile market prices for the recycled and reclaimed materials they do manage to gather.
In contrast, old electric vehicle (EV) batteries are in high demand by firms that produce new batteries, as many of the key ingredients contained in them can be processed and used again.
The problem here is that the lack of conformity in battery shapes, sizes and configurations has made it hard to automate the reclamation process, which can be laborious and expensive to do manually.
That means the cost of materials collected from recycled EV batteries can be far higher than freshly mined or processed alternatives, which can lead battery producers to favor the continued use of new ingredients even though the supply of recycled battery materials is steadily mounting.
Regulations that force battery makers to use a minimal amount of recycled material are being considered, especially in countries keen to accelerate their energy transition and develop exportable expertise in the decarbonization space.
However, as manufacturers need to be competitive against international peers, policymakers that want to intervene must be wary of creating any further unintended and potentially damaging consequences.

Old solar panels face a similar predicament, especially ones that lack the efficiency of newer models and in the eyes of resellers are not worth collecting from old sites and homes.
Again, there are a growing number of firms that do recycle old panels, but, like wind blade recyclers, they can struggle to economically procure enough stock of discarded components to make operations profitable. They can also face volatile market prices for the recycled and reclaimed materials they do manage to gather.
In contrast, old electric vehicle (EV) batteries are in high demand by firms that produce new batteries, as many of the key ingredients contained in them can be processed and used again.
The problem here is that the lack of conformity in battery shapes, sizes and configurations has made it hard to automate the reclamation process, which can be laborious and expensive to do manually.
That means the cost of materials collected from recycled EV batteries can be far higher than freshly mined or processed alternatives, which can lead battery producers to favor the continued use of new ingredients even though the supply of recycled battery materials is steadily mounting.
Regulations that force battery makers to use a minimal amount of recycled material are being considered, especially in countries keen to accelerate their energy transition and develop exportable expertise in the decarbonization space.
However, as manufacturers need to be competitive against international peers, policymakers that want to intervene must be wary of creating any further unintended and potentially damaging consequences.

Environment,/business/environment/,Biden administration approves massive Willow oil project in Alaska,Nichola Groom,2023-03-13 22:58:00+00:00,,"LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The Biden administration is approving a scaled-back version of ConocoPhillips' (COP.N) $7 billion oil and gas drilling Willow project in Alaska, the U.S. Department of Interior said on Monday, drawing cheers from Alaskan officials and the oil industry but criticism from environmental advocates.
The decision follows an aggressive eleventh-hour campaign from opponents who had argued the development of the three drill sites in northwestern Alaska conflicts with President Joe Biden's highly publicized efforts to fight climate change and shift to cleaner sources of energy.
Alaska's elected officials say the project will create hundreds of jobs and bring billions of dollars in revenue to state and federal coffers. The state relies heavily on revenue from oil production, but output there has declined dramatically from its peak in the 1980s.
""I feel the people of Alaska have been heard,"" U.S. Representative Mary Peltola, a Democrat from Alaska, said on a call with reporters. ""The state of Alaska cannot carry the burden of solving our global warming issues alone.""

The fate of the project has been closely watched as Biden seeks to balance his goals of decarbonizing the U.S. economy and restoring U.S. leadership on climate change while also increasing domestic fuel supplies to keep prices low.
The United Nations, which has urged nations to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels, criticized the move.
""These are not projects that move us in the right direction,"" spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters when asked about the Willow approval.
The Interior Department approved the project with three drill pads after saying last month it was concerned about the greenhouse gas impacts of Willow. ConocoPhillips had sought to build up to five drill sites and project infrastructure including dozens of miles of roads and pipelines and seven bridges.

The agency said the smaller scope will reduce the impact on habitats for species like polar bears and yellow-billed loons.
The administration also announced late on Sunday sweeping new protections for undisturbed Alaskan lands and waters that would keep nearly 3 million acres of the Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean ""indefinitely off limits"" for oil and gas leasing, effectively closing off U.S. Arctic waters to oil exploration. It also issued protections for 13 million acres of ""ecologically sensitive"" special areas within Alaska's petroleum reserve.
Environmental groups, however, criticized the Biden administration, saying it was trying to have it ""both ways"" on climate change.
""Promoting clean energy development is meaningless if we continue to allow corporations to plunder and pollute as they wish,” Food & Water Watch Executive Director Wenonah Hauter said.
Green groups have said they would challenge Willow in court. U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan of Alaska said the congressional delegation is expecting an imminent legal challenge and is preparing an amicus brief to defend the project.
Houston-based ConocoPhillips welcomed Monday's decision, having already endorsed the trimmed-down version of the project.
""This was the right decision for Alaska and our nation,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said in a statement.
U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, on Monday welcomed the ""good news,"" saying ""this will mean jobs and revenue for Alaska"" by bringing upwards of 180,000 barrels of oil per day into the Trans Alaska Pipeline.

Environment,/business/environment/,Dutch farmers and climate activists protest over government policies,Reuters,2023-03-11 18:17:00+00:00,,"AMSTERDAM, March 11 (Reuters) - More than 10,000 Dutch farmers protested in The Hague on Saturday against government plans to limit nitrogen emissions, a policy they say will spell the end of many farms and hit food production.
Many symbolically held the national flag upside down during the demonstration, which took place ahead of March 15 regional elections and followed similar protests by farmers in Belgium this month over nitrogen emission rules.
Elsewhere in the city, thousands of environmentalists blocked a major thoroughfare in an unauthorised protest against tax rules they say encourage the use of fossil fuels. Police used water cannon to disperse a group of about 100 of the activists late in the afternoon.
The pro-farm protesters carried banners reading ""No farmers, no food,"" and ""There is no nitrogen 'problem'"" during the peaceful demonstration organised by the Farmers' Defence Force group.

Relatively large numbers of livestock and heavy use of fertilizers have led to levels of nitrogen oxides in the soil and water in the Netherlands and Belgium that are higher than European Union regulations allow.
Farm groups say the problem has been exaggerated and that the proposed solutions are unfair and ineffective.
Next week's regional elections are significant because they will determine the make-up of the Dutch Senate, and because regional governments are responsible for translating national government goals - such as nitrogen caps - into concrete plans.
Environmentalists led by the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion scaled a wall next to the road they had blocked to hang a banner reading ""Stop fossil subsidies"".
Protesters are demanding an end to fuel tax exemptions for oil refineries and coal plants, introduced to avoid double taxation, as well as exemptions for the aviation and shipping industries that were agreed at the EU level.

Environment,/business/environment/,Travel sector mulls green future but tourists reluctant to pay,Rachel More,2023-03-13 15:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/5I3VR6N4LJK7BBLYZRNLBGQIVA.jpg,"BERLIN, March 13 (Reuters) - Tourists around the world and especially in Europe are supportive of more eco-friendly trips but reluctant to carry the extra cost, according to studies and industry executives.
In the European Union's economic powerhouse Germany, for example, 24% of travelers believe ecological sustainability is an important criterion when booking a holiday, according to a survey by motor vehicle association ADAC released this month.
But only 5-10% would be willing to pay even a moderate sustainability surcharge, according to the poll of 5,000 people.
""The rub is people don't want to necessarily pay more for sustainability,"" said Charuta Fadnis, head of research and product strategy at travel research company Phocuswright.
That has left the industry questioning how to become greener as it faces thin margins and a post-pandemic recovery still hampered by global travel restrictions, like the slow rebound of visas available to Chinese tourists.

Carbon offsets have been available on the market for years, with many airlines offering voluntary investment programmes. But the uptake has been limited and there are questions over how effective offsets actually are.
Thomas Fowler, the director of sustainability for Irish budget airline Ryanair (RYA.I) told Reuters earlier this year that few are willing to pay the few euros needed to take part in their carbon offset programme.
""Less than 3% of our customers use it,"" he said.
Germany's flagship airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) in February began offering more expensive ""green fares"" on some flights, said to offset their burden on the climate by 20% through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 80% through the financing of climate protection projects.
This is integrated into the price, unlike Lufthansa's existing opt-in charges, for which uptake has been very low at 0.1%, according to the company. A trial run for the new integrated offer in Scandinavia showed a modest but improved uptake rate of 2%.
The younger generation is more committed to sustainability, said Fadnis. But without willingness to pay slightly more upfront, businesses have to become more creative.
Many hotels, for example, ask those who stay there to reuse their towels, while other travel services encourage tourists to adjust their habits by renting hybrid cars.
Some travel operators insist that climate-friendly tourism need not cost the world and can sometimes even be the cheaper option, encouraging habits such as reusable water bottles and use of bikes or public transportation.
Time-slot bookings, made ubiquitous during the pandemic, have become a tool to prevent overcrowding and minimise visitors' footprint locally.
GetYourGuide, a Berlin-based platform for booking travel experiences, said this was one way it was reducing its impact, for example with queue management at the Vatican.
""That is much better than people ... waiting for four hours ... at the Vatican, you know, trashing the place"" GetYourGuide CEO Johannes Reck said.
Demand for greener offers is helping some businesses, but there are certain demographics that will remain stubbornly opposed to even marginal price hikes - particularly those over 55.
""They're averse to pain,"" Fadnis said.

Business,/business/environment/,EU lawmakers approve CO2-cutting targets and expanding forest carbon sinks,Kate Abnett,2023-03-14 12:22:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FGTRD665HJMA7KPS7XWFKJINEM.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 14 (Reuters) - The European Parliament gave its final approval on Tuesday to tougher national targets to cut emissions in some sectors, and expand CO2-absorbing natural ecosystems like forests.
The two laws are part of a major package of climate change legislation passing through the European Union's policymaking process, designed to ensure the 27-country bloc cuts greenhouse gas emissions 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.
One regulation sets national targets to slash planet-warming emissions in sectors including road transport, heating of buildings, agriculture and waste management.
These sectors, unlike industry and the power sector, are not covered by the EU's carbon market, but generate about 60% of EU greenhouse gas emissions.
The new law aims to curb their emissions 40% by 2030, compared with 2005. It replaces a current target for a 30% cut in these sectors.
View 2 more stories 
Richer countries face tougher targets, with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg and Sweden facing 50% emission cuts, versus Bulgaria's 10% goal. The new law also tightens the amount of emissions savings from past or future years that countries can ""bank"" and ""borrow"" to meet their targets.
""The new rules for national emission cuts ensure that all member states contribute,"" said Jessica Polfjärd, lead lawmaker on the file.
The second law would expand Europe's forests, marshes and other ""sinks"" that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, to ensure this sector removes a net 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030 - a roughly 15% increase from today.
The aim is to reverse a recent decline in Europe's carbon sinks, which can be done by recreating old forests or generating new ones, rewetting peatland or changing farming practices such as reduced tilling to trap more carbon in the soil.
Each EU country would face binding targets to absorb more emissions so that the EU-wide goal is reached.
The EU Parliament approved both laws with a comfortable majority. EU countries will vote on them in the coming months, and if approved, the laws will enter into force.
EU countries and lawmakers agreed the details last year after months of negotiations, so the final votes typically approve laws with no changes.

ING, a leading provider of commodity finance, said it was working on a methodology to reduce the volumes of traded oil and gas it finances in line with global climate goals with a view to setting targets by 2024.
Commodity trade finance covers many types of loans, most of which are for less than a year, that facilitate global movement of goods from wheat to gasoline. As of yet, none of the largest TCF banks have introduced climate-related restrictions to this part of its lending book, ING said, though Rabobank has done so.
The bank's move to restrict its activity reflects the fact the world needs to be less dependent on oil and gas - and is a sizeable part of ING's exposure to the sector -- Anne-Sophie Castelnau, global head of sustainability at ING told Reuters.
View 2 more stories 
""By committing ourselves in this direction, we are sending a signal to our clients that we are actively engaged in taking actions toward decarbonising our portfolio and progressively stepping out of that industry,"" she said.
ING said it would look to cut the volume of traded oil and gas it finances by 19% by 2030, in line with the International Energy Agency's Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 Roadmap.
ING also said it will no longer provide dedicated finance to ""midstream"" infrastructure activities such as processing and storage that helps new oil and gas fields to be developed.
The bank's lending to midstream oil and gas was about $14 billion at the end of 2022, with about 10% of that linked to new oil and fields and hence covered by the new targets, Castelnau said.
Last year ING said it would not provide dedicated upstream finance to new oil and gas fields. Its exposure to this segment stood at 3.1 billion euros at the end of 2021.
""The idea is to take into account feedback from the International Energy Agency (IEA) that the world does not need new oil fields,"" Castelnau added.

Last week, Californian regulators shut down tech lender SVB after a failed share sale that saw $42 billion of deposit outflows in a day and escalated worries of a contagion across financial markets.
The loan portfolio is seen as an attractive buy and was not a contributing factor in the bank run that caused SVB's demise, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Last week, the startup-focused lender failed to raise equity to plug a $1.8 billion hole, after it sold $21 billion worth available-for-sale securities at a loss as rising Treasury yields eroded its value.
Apollo, Blackstone, and SVB did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

U.S. President Joe Biden has sought to soothe the markets, issuing a statement on Sunday and making public remarks on Monday morning before U.S. markets opened that sought to reassure Americans that banks and deposits were safe.
His administration stepped in over the weekend to shore up the banks, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) taking over receivership.
McHenry backed the response, saying officials ""acted swiftly and boldly.""
""They currently have the tools, and they‘ve used them appropriately to resolve two banks,"" McHenry said. ""Bold action I will absolutely support if it is in the interest of the financial system and in the interest of the American people.""
Biden also vowed new bank rules after regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis were rolled back under former Republican President Donald Trump.
Any legislation would have to pass both the Senate, controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats, and the Republican-led House before Biden could sign it into law.
The panel's ranking Democrat, Maxine Waters, on Monday urged bipartisan work to ensure the stability of the financial system.

Finance chief Cristiano Borean also told reporters the leading Italian insurer had no exposure to collapsed U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) (SIVB.O) and just ""a marginal"" position in its third-party risk portfolio.
Startup-focused SVB last week became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis, sending shockwaves through the global financial system and prompting regulators to step in to contain the fallout.
""There is a crisis every year. Our excellent solvency, which results from a very diversified business model, has enabled us to overcome all the crises of the last seven years,"" Generali Chief Executive Philippe Donnet said.
With its net profit up 2.3% to 2.91 billion euros ($3.11 billion) in 2022, despite a 154 million euros hit from Russian investments, Generali is set to pay a dividend per share of 1.16 euros, ""a remarkable"" 8.4% higher than the year before, Jefferies analysts said.

Operating profit, the figure most closely watched by the market, rose 11.2% to 6.5 billion euros, above an analysts' consensus provided by the company of 6.19 billion euros as higher interest rates boosted the life insurance business, while the non-life business proved resilient.
The solvency ratio, a measure of the financial strength of Generali, stood at 221% at the end of 2022 and had risen to 230% as of March 10.
""We are on track to achieve the targets and ambitions of our strategic plan, delivering sustainable growth to create value for all our stakeholders, even in a challenging geopolitical and economic context"", Donnet said.

Finance,/business/finance/,"Americanas scandal won't affect Brazil banks much even in ""extreme scenario"" - cenbank",Reuters,2023-03-09 12:37:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7RLUS6F3SJN6ZPWRXASNTHYNTA.jpg,"BRASILIA, March 9 (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank stated on Thursday that the potential impact of the accounting scandal involving retailer Americanas SA on banks would be 'insignificant' even in an extreme scenario.
The statement was made in the minutes of last week's Financial Stability Committee meeting, which had decided to maintain a neutral macroprudential policy due to no significant increase in financial risks.
Americanas (AMER3.SA) filed for bankruptcy in January after disclosing ""accounting inconsistencies"" worth 20 billion reais ($3.84 billion), leading banks to increase their provisioning in their most recent earnings release.
The central bank noted that the provisions stem from ""a specific event related to a large company"" and have already absorbed most of the materialization of the risk.
""The central bank estimated the remaining potential impact, plus a contagion scenario over the entire production and supply chain that depends on the company in a relevant way,"" it said.
""In this extreme scenario, the impact on the consolidated financial system is insignificant and there would be no capital default in any financial institution,"" it added.

The central bank also stated that ""one-off events in large companies"" generated a deterioration in asset prices in the private bond market, with increased volatility, spreads and risk aversion, in addition to impact on some lines in the credit market.
Its committee will continue to monitor developments and is ready to act in case of dysfunctionality, it said.
In addition to Lojas Americanas, energy company Light (LIGT3.SA) disclosed earlier this year that it had hired a firm known for acting in bankruptcy protection, raising fears about it, which the company later denied.
The two incidents resulted in a flight of funds from credit funds. This occurred shortly after a new rule from the Brazilian securities industry regulator CVM began to take effect in January, implementing mark-to-market in fixed-income investments, which ended up helping to make the picture worse.

Finance,/business/finance/,"US digital asset fund, venture capital firm to raise $100 million for two new blockchain funds",Reuters,2023-03-09 04:37:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Alpha Sigma Capital, a U.S.-based digital asset fund, and Transform Ventures, a venture capital firm, will raise $100 million for two new funds focused on the blockchain and so-called decentralized Web 3.0 ventures, Alpha Sigma founder and Chief Executive Officer Enzo Villani said on Wednesday.
Transform Ventures, founded by crypto investor Michael Terpin, also merged some of its assets with Alpha Sigma's parent to form a new holding company called Alpha Transform Holdings. The latter will oversee the two new funds.
Terpin in 2019 won $75.8 million in a civil judgment against Nicholas Truglia, who was 21 years old at the time and part of a scheme that defrauded Terpin of digital currencies, according to court documents. Truglia along with other participants stole 3 million tokens from Terpin's cellphone account in early 2018.
The new Alpha Liquid digital assets fund was launched early this month, with an initial investment by Terpin, who made a personal investment in cash, bitcoin and ethereum of $2.65 million, with an option to invest an additional $2.9 million.

The second fund, a closed-end venture capital firm called the Aegean Fund, is still in the process of being established, Villani said.
These new funds have emerged as the cryptocurrency industry faces more intense scrutiny after the high-profile bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX in November and the collapse of several other market players such as lender Celsius Network.
""The real growth of blockchains and the real growth of Web 3 are starting to happen,"" Villani told Reuters in an interview. Web 3.0 refers to the third iteration of the internet in which users interact with data through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, among others.
""A lot of things that are happening right now (in the crypto and blockchain space) may be challenging. But I think the industry would be going through these (challenges) anyway,"" he added.

Finance,/business/finance/,Exclusive: Credit Suisse regulatory compliance head leaving as part of wider overhaul -sources,Stefania Spezzati,2023-03-09 16:29:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse's (CSGN.S) head of regulatory compliance, Julian Gooding, is leaving Switzerland's second-biggest bank as part of a sweeping overhaul involving thousands of job cuts, people with knowledge of the departure told Reuters.
Gooding was one of the most senior managers in compliance, overseeing anti-fraud measures as well as matters relating to market conduct and investors protection, said the two people, who asked to remain anonymous.
According to his LinkedIn profile, Gooding had been in the role since January 2022 and previously held senior positions as general counsel in various parts of the bank.
Gooding declined to comment when reached on LinkedIn.
The sources said Gooding's departure is not related to Thursday's postponement by Credit Suisse of the publication of its annual report.
Gooding, who has spent about 18 years at Credit Suisse, reported to Nita Patel, the group chief compliance officer, and his responsibilities will be reassigned, the sources added.

Credit Suisse is cutting 9,000 jobs as part of a restructuring plan announced in October to restore profitability after a series of scandals and losses that have drawn regulatory scrutiny and undermined investors confidence.
Last year, the Swiss bank posted its biggest loss since the global financial crisis of 2008 and warned of more pain to come after customers pulled an unprecedented 110 billion Swiss francs ($117 billion).
Gooding's tasks will be assigned to Roger Senteler, chief compliance officer for the wealth management unit, and Alain Bieger, chief compliance officer for the Swiss bank division, the people said.
Patel plans to hold a global town hall meeting with compliance staff later this month, they added.
Separately, Credit Suisse said on Thursday it was delaying its annual report after a last-minute call from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which raised questions about its earlier financial statements and related controls.

The move is part of a major overhaul at the loss-making bank after a string of heavy losses and scandals threatened its survival.
Credit Suisse's investment banking division, which houses capital markets and M&A advisory businesses, has undertaken a two-phase restructuring in Japan, nearly halving the number of its bankers in November and then shedding all but a few in January, two of the people said.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
""Credit Suisse remains committed to our investment banking & capital markets clients throughout the APAC (Asia Pacific) region,"" the company told Reuters in response to a query.
""Our global franchise will continue to work with clients in all key markets including Japan, as it has done for many years,"" it said.
Credit Suisse's restructuring plan includes creating a separate unit for its investment bank under the CS First Boston brand. As part of this, it is carving out the business with veteran banker Michael Klein at the helm. Credit Suisse will focus on managing money for the wealthy after the revamp.

Reuters was not immediately able to ascertain whether the few remaining staff at Credit Suisse's Japanese investment banking division would be shifted to the new unit.
Credit Suisse also runs wealth management, equity research, securities trading and asset management businesses in Japan.

Finance,/business/finance/,"After SVB failure, US acts to shore up banking system confidence",Andrea Shalal,2023-03-13 18:35:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON/SINGAPORE, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities launched emergency measures on Sunday to shore up confidence in the banking system after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) threatened to trigger a broader financial crisis.
After a dramatic weekend, regulators said the failed bank’s customers will have access to all their deposits starting Monday and set up a new facility to give banks access to emergency funds. The Federal Reserve also made it easier for banks to borrow from it in emergencies.
While the measures provided some relief for Silicon Valley firms and global markets on Monday, worries about broader banking risks remain and have cast doubts over whether the Fed will stick with its plan for aggressive interest rate hikes.
""We think the steps taken by the Fed, Treasury and (the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp) will decisively break the psychological 'doom loop' across the regional banking sector,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.
View 2 more stories 
""But, fairly or not, the episode will contribute to higher levels of background volatility, with investors watching warily for other cracks to emerge as the Fed's policy tightening continues.""
Regulators also moved swiftly to close New York’s Signature Bank , which had come under pressure in recent days.
The wider efforts to avert a crisis lifted Wall Street stock futures in Asian trade on Monday, helping broader markets.
Lingering concerns about the financial sector weighed on bank shares in Asia, with Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ (8306.T) hitting a two-month low and Singapore's DBS (DBSM.SI) a four-month low. Hong Kong shares of HSBC and Standard Chartered pared early losses to trade near-flat.
European stock markets fell 0.6% in early trade (.STOXX), while banking stocks fell just over 1%. U.S. stock futures were higher. Asian shares outside Japan climbed over 1% (.MIAPJ0000PUS) while the blue-chip Nikkei (.N225) tumbled 1%.
The Biden administration's intervention underscores how a relentless campaign by the Fed and other major central banks to beat back inflation is putting stress in the financial system and global markets.
Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), a mainstay for the startup economy, was a product of the decades-long era of cheap money, with unique risks that made it especially vulnerable. But as a run on the bank ensued last week, worries that other regional banks shared similarities spread quickly.
With the Fed poised to continue raising rates, investors said the financial system may not be fully out of the woods yet.
Goldman Sachs analysts said they no longer expect the Fed to raise rates by 25 basis points at its next policy meeting on March 21-22, amid the stress in the banking sector.
""What investors have to expect coming into tomorrow and beyond is that we are going to be dealing with a lot of event risk,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""There are still going to be lingering questions with other regional banks.""
The collapse of SVB - the largest bank failure since 2008 - sparked concerns over whether small-business clients would be able to pay their staff, with the FDIC only protecting deposits of up to $250,000.
Some 89% of SVB's $175 billion in deposits were uninsured as of the end of 2022, according to the FDIC.
All depositors, including those whose funds exceed the maximum government-insured level, will be made whole, according to a joint statement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chair Martin Gruenberg on Sunday evening.
A senior U.S. Treasury official said the actions taken would protect depositors, while providing additional support to the broader banking system, but officials and regulators were continuing to monitor financial system stability.

""The firms are not being bailed out. The depositors are being protected,"" the official said.
The risk would be borne by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which has sufficient funds to do so.
Providing the systemic risk exceptions was deemed quicker than waiting for a possible buyer, the official said.
Treasury officials said depositors of New York's Signature Bank, which was closed Sunday by the New York state financial regulator, would also be made whole at no loss to the taxpayer.
Signature, like SVB, had a clientele concentrated in the tech sector, and the securities on its balance sheet had eroded as interest rates rose. As of September, almost a quarter of Signature’s deposits came from the cryptocurrency sector, but the bank announced in December that it would shrink its crypto-related deposits by $8 billion.
While all customer deposits will be protected, new policies adopted Sunday will ""wipe out"" equity and bondholders in SVB and Signature Bank, a senior U.S. Treasury official said.
Together with the Fed's decision to ensure financial institutions can meet the needs of all their depositors, the steps would ""restore market confidence,"" the official said.
Fed fund futures surged on Monday to imply only a 17% chance of a half-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve when it meets next week, well off the 70% before the SVB news broke last week.
The Fed said it would make additional funding available through a new Bank Term Funding Program, which would offer loans of up to one year to depository institutions, backed by Treasuries and other assets these institutions hold.
When the coronavirus pandemic triggered financial panic in March 2020, the Fed announced a series of measures to keep credit flowing by lowering borrowing costs and lengthening the terms of direct loans. By the end of that month, use of the Fed's discount window facility shot up to more than $50 billion.
Through the middle of last week, before SVB's collapse, there had been no indications of usage picking up, with Fed data showing weekly outstanding balances of $4 billion to $5 billion since the start of the year.
In Britain, where SVB has a subsidiary, the government and Bank of England held talks over weekend to find a solution that would avert the local lender from failing.
In a move reminiscent of the financial crisis era, early on Monday in London HSBC (HSBA.L) announced it was buying Silicon Valley Bank UK for 1 pound ($1.21). It said the subsidiary had loans of around 5.5 billion pounds and deposits of around 6.7 billion pounds as of March 10.
While SVB UK is small - HSBC's balance sheet exceeds $2.9 trillion - concerns that SVB's failure would cause Britain's start-up industry to seize up had prompted calls from the sector for government to intervene.
British start-ups backed by venture capital have around 2.5 billion pounds, largely in deposits, ""locked"" in SVB UK, according to a weekend survey by an industry body, seen by Reuters.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,Older Eli Lilly's drug fails Alzheimer's prevention trial,Deena Beasley,2023-03-08 22:05:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FXRJC64ERFLQXCC6J6I64M2ZVI.jpg,"March 8 (Reuters) - An early-generation Alzheimer's drug from Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) failed to slow cognitive decline in patients treated before they showed symptoms, but the large trial found a strong link between levels of brain plaques and disease progression, the company said on Wednesday.
The experimental drug, solanezumab, was designed to target only soluble forms of amyloid beta, a toxic protein that accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. The drug, which does not clear existing plaques, was abandoned by Lilly in 2016 after it did not slow loss of mental functioning in patients with mild Alzheimer's symptoms in clinical trials.
The latest data highlight the need for ""more aggressive therapies to lower plaque,"" and will inform the structure of future trials of amyloid-targeting drugs, said John Sims, senior medical director at Lilly.
The U.S. drugmaker is in late-stage development with two other Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and remternetug, that specifically target deposited amyloid and have been shown to clear plaque in treated patients.

Although Lilly halted development of solanezumab, it supported, along with the National Institute on Aging and others, the randomized clinical trial of the drug in over 1,100 asymptomatic Alzheimer's patients.
The study, which started in 2013, did not meet its primary goal of slowing cognitive decline, and placebo patients actually did better on secondary goals, such as changes in daily activity. Just over 36% of trial participants developed symptomatic Alzheimer's, and rates of progression were similar for both the treatment and placebo groups, Lilly said.
""Even at this preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease, we are going to have to be more aggressive with amyloid."" said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a neurologist at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who led the study. ""We need to get people's amyloid lower, very fast, and keep it there.""
Lilly expects to announce results from a Phase III trial of donanemab for early Alzheimer's before the end of June. If the findings are robust, the company will file for U.S. approval, which could occur in late 2023, Sims said.
The company is conducting a 3,300-patient trial of donanemab in asymptomatic Alzheimer's patients. It is also launching a late-stage trial of remternetug, which can be given by subcutaneous injection.
""We hope that if we can intervene on the amyloid and get rid of the plaque very early that we will have a fairly large effect on preventing people from becoming symptomatic,"" Sims said.

Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,"Novo obesity drug to launch in the UK soon, says watchdog",Natalie Grover,2023-03-08 00:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/S5KRGMJWWZIODB4BZYJ4W73ETE.jpg,"LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk's (NOVOb.CO) keenly anticipated weight loss medicine, Wegovy, will soon be made available to thousands of people in the UK, the country's drug cost-effectiveness watchdog NICE said on Wednesday.
Data from a clinical trial showed that participants on Wegovy lost on average 12.4% more of their body weight than those who received a placebo.
The drug’s use will be limited to adults being treated at an specialist NHS weight management service who have at least one weight-related condition, such as heart disease, and body mass index (BMI) - a measure of body fat based on height and weight - of 35 indicating obesity, alongside diet and exercise adjustments, NICE said.
It could also be prescribed to people with a slightly lower BMI than the limit it set in certain cases.
The main active ingredient in Wegovy is semaglutide, the same as the Danish drugmaker's blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic.
The drugs belong to a family of medicines known as GLP-1 analogues originally designed to control blood sugar but that also led to weight loss by making people feel full. Other drugmakers are also repurposing similar diabetes medicines as weight loss treatments.

Patients can inject themselves with Wegovy once a week, but the drug will only be used for a maximum of two years, NICE said. Its regulatory endorsement was based on clinical data tracking the drug’s safety and effectiveness for about two years.
Longer-term data is expected to be published this year and will be shared with health authorities, including the NHS, a Novo spokesperson said.
A follow-up to the initial clinical trial - in which participants were monitored after stopping Wegovy - showed that they all regained nearly all the weight lost over the course of the following year, said Dr Simon Cork from Anglia Ruskin University.
This demonstrates that obesity is a lifelong condition and that semaglutide is a treatment rather than a cure, he said, adding that it was likely Wegovy would offer only temporary weight loss for many of the patients to whom it is prescribed.
About 28% of adults in England are considered obese, and a further 36% are overweight, NICE said, citing 2019 figures.
Wegovy has been in great demand since its initial launch in the United States.
According to Novo Nordisk, sales grew nearly 300% in local currencies last year, despite serious supply issues throughout 2022, partly due to manufacturing constraints the company is working to alleviate.
A spokesperson said there is no official UK launch date for the drug, but the company is working on making it available as soon as possible.

Media & Telecom,/business/media-telecom/,BBC seeks to quell furore by putting Lineker back on air,Sarah Young,2023-03-13 16:54:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Britain's BBC reinstated its highest-paid presenter Gary Lineker on Monday after its suspension of the former England football captain for criticising state immigration policy brought a public backlash and near mutiny at the public broadcaster.
Embarrassingly for the BBC, it had to axe core weekend sports coverage after presenters, pundits and commentators refused to work in solidarity with Lineker.
Some staff, opposition politicians and commentators accused the corporation, which has a mandate to be neutral, of bowing to pressure from the government, prompting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to urge a swift resolution of the situation.
The affair also renewed questions over the credibility of BBC chairman Richard Sharp. He failed to declare facilitating a loan for former Prime Minister Boris Johnson shortly before he was appointed to the role by the government.
View 2 more stories 
The 62-year-old Lineker, a prolific striker who won the Golden Boot with England at the 1986 World Cup, is expected to return on Saturday for the flagship Premier League highlights show ""Match Of The Day"" which he has hosted since 1999.
""I have been presenting sport on the BBC for almost three decades and am immeasurably proud to work with the best and fairest broadcaster in the world,"" he tweeted, before returning to the topic of immigration.
""However difficult the last few days have been, it simply doesn't compare to having to flee your home from persecution or war to seek refuge in a land far away.""
The publicly-funded BBC suspended him for breaching impartiality rules by comparing the rhetoric of interior minister Suella Braverman to language used in 1930s Germany.
Braverman has described the arrival of thousands of asylum seekers on small boats as an ""invasion"" and said that without a legal change, 100 million people could be entitled to enter.
Lineker has previously hosted refugees in his home and co-founded a podcast production company whose shows include the popular ""The Rest is Politics"". He had called the new government hardline policy towards boats ""immeasurably cruel.""
The furore came as the broadcaster seeks to navigate increasingly polarised debate in Britain over everything from trans rights to immigration and colonial history.
One senior BBC News employee said Lineker's tweets had arguably undermined its attempt to stay impartial, but said most anger within the corporation was directed at the chairman.
""Everyone suspects, though we can't know for sure, that if Lineker had tweeted support for the government's migrant policy then he wouldn't have been suspended,"" the employee told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
The BBC said it would now review how freelancers such as Lineker, in areas outside news, can use social media.
Sunak's spokesperson welcomed the resolution.
The BBC board, led by chairman Sharp, welcomed the agreement and described impartiality as a ""cornerstone"" of the BBC.
Keir Starmer, the leader of the opposition Labour Party, said Sharp's position was increasingly untenable.
Tim Davie became BBC director general in 2020, vowing to uphold the corporation's impartiality, one of the principles used to justify the 159 pounds ($192) a-year licence fee imposed on every TV-watching household.
He said in a BBC interview on Monday that the suspension had been appropriate and that the presenter had agreed to stick to current editorial guidelines until a new policy is formed.
However, in a statement announcing the agreement with Lineker, he acknowledged ""potential confusion caused by the grey areas"" of those guidelines and welcomed him back.
""I know how much the BBC means to Gary, and I look forward to him presenting our coverage this coming weekend,"" he said.
Lineker was supportive, saying Davie had ""an almost impossible job keeping everybody happy, particularly in the area of impartiality"".

Retail & Consumer,/business/retail-consumer/,H&M launches U.S. resale program,Katherine Masters,2023-03-14 12:04:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Fast-fashion retailer H&M (HMb.ST) launched a resale program Tuesday in collaboration with ThredUp, an online consignment platform that has partnered with dozens of brands to run their used clothing sales, H&M told Reuters.
H&M will be the largest retailer to work with ThredUp, and the partnership will mark the retailer's first resale marketplace in the United States, according to Abigail Kammerzell, head of sustainability for H&M North America.
""We’ve been working in secondhand since about 2015, really testing and learning,"" she said. ""And what we know is we need to make it easier to adopt. We need to make it user-friendly and we need to make it easy to access.""
Roughly 30,000 articles of clothing will initially be available on H&M’s resale site. ThredUp is responsible for powering the site and restocking it with H&M pieces sent in by users.

Other clothing retailers, including Inditex's Zara and online fashion retailer SHEIN, have also launched resale marketplaces as shoppers express growing interest in sustainability initiatives. Brokerage Morningstar has estimated that the resale market could grow to $300 billion by 2031.
Kammerzell said H&M viewed resale as part of its wider push toward sustainable practices, which has also included launching a denim collection made with recycled materials and a program that offers coupons to customers who bring in clothing for recycling.
The company has previously been criticized for marketing its clothing as more eco-friendly than it actually is, with a 2022 lawsuit accused H&M of 'greenwashing' for displaying sustainability scores that falsified information on how the clothing was manufactured.
An H&M spokesperson said the company is continuing to investigate ""irregularities"" in the scores and removed them from its website after the coalition that developed the scoring metric paused its use.
Some critics say that efforts by H&M and other large retailers to enter the resale market are undercut by the volume of clothing they produce.
Lucy Dunne, a professor at the University of Minnesota, said fashion sustainability should include efforts to cut back on production and consumption along with other initiatives. ""If they’re not actually producing less, that is not helping anybody,"" she said.
H&M does not currently plan to slow its clothing launches or reduce the overall number of items it sells, according to Kammerzell.
""We are in a business that produces things, so it's not really about our volume of production,"" she said. ""It’s about how you’re designing and producing for circularity.""

The battle between them is playing out not only on social media but also in a U.S. court. The legal skirmish is important for U.S. consumers and rival retailers because it shows how online retailers with vendors in China need to navigate U.S. intellectual property protections.
In U.S. federal court, SHEIN has accused Temu of contracting social-media influencers to make ""false and deceptive statements"" against SHEIN in their promotions of Temu.com.
If Temu loses, Temu could be forced to curtail its use of social media influencers as a key marketing strategy. SHEIN seeks to block Temu from using SHEIN's name for marketing, and it wants damages from sales that SHEIN could show came through ""deceptive"" or ""infringing"" marketing.

Temu has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. The court has not ruled on the case.
“I think as Temu gets a higher profile, there will just be more and more lawsuits. Including IP, but probably not just IP. I'm sure there will be data-related things as well,” US and China tech analyst Rui Ma said.
SHEIN produces clothing in China to sell online in the United States, Europe and Asia, offering items such as $10 dresses and $5 tops. SHEIN, originally founded in China, relies on drop-shipping directly from its extensive network of China-based suppliers.
SHEIN is set to raise around $2 billion in a new funding round this month and is aiming for a U.S. listing in the second half of this year, three people with knowledge of its plans told Reuters. SHEIN said it does not currently have plans for an IPO and declined to comment further.
SHEIN's lawsuit against Temu, filed in December in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleges that Temu told social media influencers to make disparaging remarks about the fast-fashion retailer, and tricked customers into downloading the Temu app using ""imposter"" social media accounts.
Social media influencers on TikTok often mention SHEIN in posts about Temu, comparing the companies and their merchandise.
""I am not with Shein anymore,"" one influencer said in a February post on TikTok. ""I am with Temu who has the same and more for less.""
The now-deleted @SHEIN_DC, @SHEIN_USA_, and @SHEIN_NYC pages were created in September and displayed SHEIN's logo and marketing material on their bio pages, according to screenshots provided with SHEIN's complaint.
""Temu has also attempted to impersonate the SHEIN brand and trick consumers into believing Temu is associated with that brand,"" the lawsuit alleges.
SHEIN said that links on the imposter pages led shoppers to download Temu's app, under the impression that the two companies were related. A SHEIN spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.
A Temu.com spokesperson said the company ""strongly and categorically rejects all allegations and is vigorously defending its rights.""
Temu maintains that it never impersonated SHEIN and ""played no part in the creation"" of the Twitter accounts, according to its motion to dismiss the lawsuit. It also said ""there is nothing actionable"" about finding influencers who believe Temu compares favorably to SHEIN, or asking them to share those opinions.”
SHEIN itself has faced lawsuits alleging copyright infringement. Under the name Zoetop Business, it was sued by dozens of independent artists and retailers including Nike (NKE.N), Deckers' (DECK.N) UGG brand, Luxottica Group's Oakley shades and online retailer Dolls Kill, alleging stolen designs.
PDD Holdings (PDD.O), which owns China's popular Pinduoduo app, launched Temu in September as a new app for U.S. shoppers to buy shoes, jewelry, beauty accessories and home goods directly from Chinese merchants.
Temu's gross merchandise value - the total sales before expenses - grew from $3 million in September to $192 million in January, according to data firm YipitData. The company plans to roll out in Australia and New Zealand this year after launching in Canada in February.
The company's social media efforts started months ago, according to job postings by Nanopower, Temu's marketing agency. In the U.S., Temu is paying social media influencers $100 to $1,000 an hour for content plugging the Temu marketplace on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube.
Temu is currently hiring a corporate/tax lawyer, according to a job posting on LinkedIn.

Retail & Consumer,/business/retail-consumer/,Gap sees weak sales as inflation-hit consumers rein in spending on apparel,Ananya Mariam Rajesh,2023-03-09 23:12:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/SOKEMKL6MFKG7CUOACO66G7MJA.jpg,"March 9 (Reuters) - Gap Inc (GPS.N) on Thursday posted a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and forecast full-year sales below Wall Street estimates, signaling a slowdown in demand for its apparel as inflation-weary consumers curb discretionary spending.
Shares of the company fell about 8% in extended trading after the Banana Republic parent also forecast first-quarter sales below estimates.
With the Federal Reserve prepared to raise interest rates more than expected in an attempt to control inflation, consumers, especially at the lower- to mid-income rung, have turned more cautious and curbed spending on non-essential items.
The company's efforts to offer promotions and steeper discounts during the holiday quarter to get rid of excess inventory and spur demand further hurt its margins.
Gap also said the chief executive officer of Athleta, Mary Beth Laughton, was exiting the business effective immediately and a search is underway to find a new CEO for the brand.
The company is also seeing a slowdown in demand for casual and active wear as people returning to social occasions prefer more formal clothing. Sales at all of Gap's four brands were down in the reported quarter, with Athleta falling 1%.

While Old Navy, Gap's biggest brand has been struggling with outdated inventory, Chief Finance Officer Katrina O'Connell said Banana Republic had some holiday product misses including over-assorted sweaters and outerwear, with the gifting assortment not resonating with the consumer.
""We expect the next few quarters to be tough on Gap with a weaker economic backdrop than the previous two years and new management,"" CFRA Research analyst Zachary Warring said.
Gap expects first-quarter and annual gross margin expansion but Warring added this margin improvement is ""nothing to get excited about.""
The company expects fiscal 2023 net sales to decrease in the low- to mid-single digit range, compared with analysts' expectations of 1.64% rise, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

""We capitalised on the end of the (COVID) restrictions and the return to normality last year with a push for new shops,"" Toni Ruiz, the CEO of the privately owned retailer, told a news conference.
Revenue at Mango, which is a rival of Spanish Inditex-owned label Zara, rose 20% from a year earlier, with both in-store and online sales benefitting from consumers' post-pandemic appetite for clothes, despite tough competition in the apparel business.
Its net profit rose 21% to 81 million euros ($85.66 million).
Mango began to increase its presence in India and opened a flagship store in New York in May, one of nine new shops opened in the United States last year and of 119 outlets in all its markets.

""The United States is a great market and should become one of our top five very quickly,"" Ruiz added. It will expand the number of U.S. stores to 40 by 2024.
In 2023, Mango is planning to open 35 new stores in India, its leading market in Asia where it will have 110 outlets.
Last year Mango started to transfer the 55 shops it was directly operating in Russia, which is under Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, to local partners.
While 30 shops permanently closed, Mango said it remained present in 90 stores in Russia under franchise agreements.
The company has 2,566 outlets worldwide and expects to open more shops in 2023 than last year, but only a third will be company-owned.
Mango, which has lately pushed to produce more in nearby countries such as Turkey, said most of its suppliers were not affected by the Feb. 6 earthquake.

Retail & Consumer,/business/retail-consumer/,"Adidas, burnt by Kanye West split, seeks a new focus",Helen Reid,2023-03-09 06:29:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Adidas (ADSGn.DE), burnt by the end of its tie-up with the artist formerly known as Kanye West, needs a new focus but should think more tactically about fresh celebrity partnerships and not count so much on one personality, industry experts said.
New chief executive Bjorn Gulden on Wednesday stood by the company's decision to cut ties with the rapper, known as Ye since 2021, but also pointed to the unique value of the Yeezy shoe brand, which became a key profit driver.
Sportswear firms have for years worked with celebrities, in lucrative but potentially risky deals. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Gulden said Adidas would keep partnering not just with athletes but celebrities and artists.
""It's not a matter of either/or, you have to do both,"" he said. ""You build credibility as a performance brand by being with athletes, but there's very few athletes that you can do lifestyle with.""
View 2 more stories 
Gulden did, however, hint at a change of emphasis at Adidas, saying the company needs to refocus on its core.
""You will see us invest in more sports, and be wider again than we have been, because that is also the DNA of this company,"" he said.
Gulden, who took the reins on Jan. 1, has pledged to turn Adidas around after it warned of a possible 700 million euro operating loss this year as a result of cutting ties with Ye.
The scale of the hit shocked investors as Adidas had not previously disclosed the revenue generated by Yeezy, the result of what the company said in 2016 was ""the most significant partnership ever created between a non-athlete and an athletic brand"".
Six years after calling Ye a ""creative pioneer"" with ""visionary imagination"", Adidas ended the collaboration citing ""unacceptable, hateful and dangerous"" comments made by the star on social media and in interviews starting in October last year.
In learning from this episode, Adidas could be more cautious in selecting celebrities to partner with, and make sure it spreads its bets, said Cristina Fernandez, senior research analyst at Telsey Advisory Group in New York.
""To me it's about diversification, but also about that specific celebrity or athlete maybe not being as risky as this one was.""
One example of a long-lived and lucrative relationship is the 38-year partnership between U.S. sportswear giant Nike and Michael Jordan for the Air Jordan line of basketball shoes and clothing.
The Jordan brand brought in $5.1 billion of sales in Nike's 2022 fiscal year, up 7% from 2021, according to the company's 2022 annual report.
While Adidas has worked with celebrities including Beyonce, Pharrell Williams, Stella McCartney and Rita Ora, and last month launched a new label with actor Jenna Ortega, the Yeezy line has been the most successful.
""Partnerships with celebrities clearly play a big role, but there is a risk because the person you partner with can go off the rails,"" said Mario Ortelli, managing director at luxury and high-end retail advisory firm Ortelli & Co.
Ortelli said Adidas has been spreading itself too thinly with celebrity partnerships and collections with brands including Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and Moncler.
Gulden said brand tie-up announcements were delayed due to the pandemic, resulting in several being unveiled in quick succession.
""We will work with brand partners in the future, but probably not four within 18 months,"" he said.
On the whole, investors back Gulden, previously CEO of neighbour and rival Puma, to turn Adidas around: its shares are up 23% since his appointment on Nov. 8.
""The CEO has come from a story of fantastic growth [at Puma],"" said Ortelli. ""Let's see if he can make the same magic at Adidas.""

The letter comes after two top proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote in favor of the assessment at Starbucks' annual shareholder meeting on March 23.
""We believe Starbucks' anti-union campaign against us violates the company's own commitment to respect its employees' rights,"" Workers United said in the letter, which it will send to investors on Friday.
The fight between labor and Starbucks has become increasingly frothy, with both sides alleging that the other is not bargaining in good faith.
Starbucks workers have filed more than 500 charges against the company with the National Labor Relations Board, which has ordered the company to reinstate 22 fired employees including some union supporters.

The J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study, which is in its 43rd year, saw a year-over-year score decline for the first time in 28 years.
Automakers are committing billions toward developing and building EVs and batteries as they shift their focus to cleaner mobility alternatives, but customer service satisfaction remains low.
Recall rates, which are more than double for BEVs than their gas/diesel counterparts, are a leading factor, the report said.
BEV owners' customer service satisfaction was 42 points lower than owners of ICE engines.
""As the electric vehicle segment grows, service is going to be a 'make or break' part of the ownership experience,"" said Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power.
""The industry has been hyper-focused on launches and now these customers are bringing their electric vehicles in for maintenance and repairs.""

The study shows a decline of 23 points in satisfaction when an owner has to bring their vehicle in for a repair after a recall rather than traditional maintenance and repair.
Since its report in 2021, the consultants have found that owners now have to wait longer for their vehicles to be serviced due to labor, loaner vehicle availability and parts shortages.
Lexus ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among all premium brands and Mitsubishi takes top spot among mass market brands, according to the report.
The 2023 U.S. CSI Study is based on responses from 64,248 verified registered owners and lessees of 2020 to 2022 model-year vehicles.

Charged,/business/charged/,Honda to move Accord production to Indiana as part of EV shift,David Shepardson,2023-03-14 12:03:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LBFPGEY3TROIXHI7ZJHFDTLXSI.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co's U.S. unit said on Tuesday it would move production of its Accord sedan to Indiana in 2025 after assembling the model in Marysville, Ohio for more than 40 years, as part of its shift to electric vehicle (EV) production.
Marysville will be Honda's first U.S. auto plant to transition to making EVs.
The move comes after Honda and South Korea's LG Energy Solution Ltd (373220.KS), (373220.KS) in October announced they would build planned $4.4 billion joint-venture battery plant at a site near Jeffersonville, Ohio and broke ground earlier this month.
The battery plant, to be completed by the end of 2024, will cover more than 2 million square feet (185,806 square meters) and aims for about 40 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of annual production capacity.
Honda said last year it was separately investing $700 million to retool three Ohio plants for electric vehicle production by 2026, including Marysville.
Marysville will begin preparing for EV production as early as January by consolidating its two production lines to one to enable it to begin building the EV infrastructure, the company said.

Honda began assembling the Accord at its Marysville in November 1982, making it the first Japanese automaker to produce cars in the United States. It has since produced more than 12.5 million Accords at the Ohio plant.
In 1989, the Accord was the first Japanese model to hold the title of best-selling U.S. car, with 362,700 vehicles sold.
In recent years, Americans have been moving away from sedans to sport utility and crossover vehicles. Honda sold 154,600 Accords in the U.S. last year, down 24% from 2021.
Honda said Accord production will be transferred to its Indiana auto plant, which builds the Civic Hatchback and CR-V.
Honda's transmission plant in Georgia will dedicate one production line to e-axle production - a key EV component - and its Anna, Ohio engine plant will shift production of some engine components to a Honda engine plant in Alabama to prepare for production of battery cases for EV models, the company said.

Charged,/business/charged/,Rubio takes aim at planned Ford US battery plant using Chinese technology,David Shepardson,2023-03-09 22:55:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio on Thursday introduced legislation that takes aim at Ford Motor's (F.N) deal to use technology from Chinese battery company CATL (300750.SZ) as part of the automaker's plan to spend $3.5 billion to build a battery plant in Michigan.
Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, introduced legislation that would block tax credits for electric vehicle batteries produced using Chinese technology, saying it would ""significantly restrict the eligibility of IRA tax credits and prevent Chinese companies from benefiting.""
Ford said in response to Rubio that ""making those batteries here at home is much better than continuing to rely exclusively on foreign imports, like other auto companies do. A wholly owned Ford subsidiary alone will build, own and operate this plant. No other entity will get U.S. tax dollars for this project.""
Last month, Rubio asked the Biden administration to review Ford's deal to use technology from CATL.
View 2 more stories 
Rubio called for an immediate Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review of the licensing agreement between Ford and CATL.
Rubio said the deal ""will only deepen U.S. reliance on the Chinese Communist Party for battery tech, and is likely designed to make the factory eligible for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits.""
CFIUS is a U.S. Treasury-led interagency panel that reviews proposed transactions to ensure they do not harm national security.
Treasury declined to comment, but Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said last month the Ford deal will ""bringing advanced manufacturing capabilities from overseas to the United States is key to our competitiveness, will stimulate our economy, and create good-paying American jobs.""
Ford has said the plant would create 2,500 jobs and begin producing lower cost and faster recharging lithium-iron-phosphate batteries in 2026.
The $430 billion IRA imposes restrictions on battery sourcing and is designed to wean the United States off the Chinese supply chain for electric vehicles (EVs). The IRA will eventually bar credits if any EV battery components were manufactured by a ""foreign entity of concern,"" in a provision aimed at China.
Separately, Democratic Senator Joe Manchin criticized comments by a White House adviser that Chinese companies will be “big players” in growing domestic energy production.
""It is beyond irresponsible for someone speaking on behalf of the White House to not only condone but also advocate for sending American tax dollars to Chinese companies,"" Manchin said.

Charged,/business/charged/,EU pushes against 'Made in USA' rule for EV support,Philip Blenkinsop,2023-03-09 18:56:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/WYEHABRAHZLGXEOYKBIQNFQCVQ.jpg,"STOCKHOLM, March 9 (Reuters) - The European Union is trying to convince the United States to ease requirements that electric vehicles must be 'Made in the USA' to qualify for tax credits, even as the two sides near a deal on raw materials, a senior EU official said on Thursday.
Washington is providing tax credits of up to $7,500 for consumers buying electric vehicles, but only if final assembly and battery components amounting to at least half of the value are made in North America.
European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, who oversees EU trade policy, said discussions were continuing on these local content requirements and that the EU wanted to establish how battery components were defined.
""Is it only specific battery components or everything? And indeed that was a subject of discussion with Treasury Secretary Yellen last Thursday. So there the work is ongoing,"" he told a briefing in Stockholm before a ministerial meeting on trade.
View 2 more stories 
The Treasury Department is due to set guidelines later this month.
""They need to respect the letter of the law, but still there's room for manoeuvre,"" Dombrovskis said.
A further criteria for the tax credit is that a large share of critical materials comes from a U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) partner, which the European Union is not.
The United States and the European Union are nevertheless working towards a deal to make European minerals eligible for tax credits, a senior EU official said on Friday. The EU would be considered as having ""FTA-equivalent"" status.
Dombrovskis confirmed this, with an announcement expected to be made on Friday when U.S. President Joe Biden and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen meet.
Dombrovskis said the European Union also wanted to create a critical raw materials ""club"" that would pool like-minded consuming and producing countries, as a counterbalance to China, which dominates processing of lithium and rare earths.

Charged,/business/charged/,China battery giant CATL reports slower Q4 profit growth,Reuters,2023-03-09 15:56:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NW5RH5XVYVKW3OAA2UENGQKOJY.jpg,"SHANGHAI, March 9 (Reuters) - Chinese battery giant CATL posted sharply slower growth in fourth quarter net profit, after COVID-19 outbreaks and consumer caution hit electric vehicle (EV) demand in the world's largest auto market.
The world's largest battery maker's profit during October to December increased 60.6% from the same period in 2021, according to Reuters calculations based on a company filing. That compares to 130.9% and 164% growth in the third and second quarters, respectively.
EV sales growth in China largely slowed in the fourth quarter as the economy was heavily disrupted by efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 and then the sudden ending of the virus prevention policy, which unleashed a massive wave of infections across the country.
Tesla, CATL's largest client by volume, cut output in its Shanghai plant by more than a third in December from November, China Passenger Car Association data showed, as the U.S. automaker grappled with rising inventory.
View 2 more stories 
The trend has extended to the first quarter even though Tesla and its Chinese rivals have started slashing prices of their best-selling models to boost sales in what analysts have described as a price war.
CATL offered discounts to some Chinese automaking clients, Reuters reported last month, reflecting a downturn in the price of lithium and a bid to win more orders.
CATL recorded full year profit of 30.7 billion yuan ($4.41 billion), according to the company's filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, largely in line with its estimates in January.
The gross profit margin of its battery products to power electric vehicles, which contributed the majority of CATL's revenue, stood at 17.2% in 2022, down 4.8% from a year ago, according to the filing.

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,FDA mandates breast density information with mammography results,Reuters,2023-03-09 22:25:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XRR76P24JFOS5KOFHRKLM56YBM.jpg,"March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday all mammography facilities in the country will be required to notify patients about the density of their breast tissues, as that can potentially make detection of tumors more difficult.
Breast density can influence the accuracy of mammography, which relies on X-rays passing through breast tissues to diagnose and locate tumors.
Mammograms remain the best tool for screening and detection of breast cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer among women in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The agency recommends patients with dense breasts, a normal and common finding in mammograms, to discuss their individual situation with their respective healthcare providers.
The updated rules will help ensure patients receive information on the potential need for further evaluation or a repeat mammogram, the health regulator said.
""Increasing early detection is the best way to improve outcomes, and this new standard does just that,"" Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick said in a statement.

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,"Pfizer ready to launch RSV vaccines for older adults, pregnant women in US, Europe",Maggie Fick,2023-03-09 21:59:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PMN2KSP6HZIKBEGKPN77OEIWBU.jpg,"PUURS, Belgium March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) is ready to launch its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for both older adults and pregnant women in the United States and Europe later this year, executives said on Thursday.
Both Pfizer and British drugmaker GSK (GSK.L) have RSV vaccines they hope to launch in the United States and Europe this year, pending regulators’ approval.
“We are anticipating approval in both the U.S. and Europe in time for rollout in the fall,” Kena Swanson, Pfizer head of viral vaccines research & development, told a media briefing at the company's biggest manufacturing and packaging site globally.
RSV is a leading cause of pneumonia in infants and the elderly, and decades of research have finally resulted in the two successful vaccines Pfizer and GSK are racing to introduce.
Some 14,000 people die annually in the United States of the lower respiratory tract disease caused by the virus, and analysts see a multibillion-dollar market for the vaccine by the end of the decade.
A GSK executive on Wednesday told Reuters that it was also ready to launch its RSV vaccine for older adults in the United States this year without supply constraints.

Neither company would say how many doses of their vaccines they intended to have ready for their respective launches.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to approve both vaccines for people aged 60 and above by May, while an FDA decision on the use of Pfizer's vaccine for pregnant women is due in August. The EU's decision, which could pave the way for the vaccines to be introduced in the UK as well, are due in the second half of the year.
Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer head of vaccines research & development, told the same briefing that the company anticipates a population of about 4 million pregnant women annually in the United States who could eventually receive its RSV vaccine, though the market will take time to shape.
She later told Reuters that the so-called ""tripledemic"" that hit the northern hemisphere this winter may have at least temporarily raised awareness of RSV, which despite its dangers for the very old and very young is not well known by the public.
""In the U.S. (this winter), the pediatric hospitals were full of babies all with RSV..., it certainly hit the news and people were much more aware,"" she said.
Given how contagious the virus is, the best way to protect infants from contracting the virus and becoming severely ill is by vaccinating their mothers during pregnancy, Anderson said.
GSK last year voluntarily stopped its clinical trial of its own RSV vaccine on pregnant women and is currently only pursuing the use of its vaccine on older adults, a company spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday.

Future of Health,/business/future-of-health/,GSK expects US launch of RSV vaccine with no supply issues,Maggie Fick,2023-03-09 09:56:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/RKCPMZ7S5JMZHA7LO754L4AON4.jpg,"LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - GSK (GSK.L) expects to launch its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in the U.S. this year without supply constraints and sees China as a major future market for the shot, a senior executive told Reuters.
The drugmaker is racing rival Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) to introduce the first approved RSV vaccine in the United States, where 14,000 people die annually of the lower respiratory tract disease caused by the virus.
Last week, a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration held separate votes on the two vaccines and backed both. The FDA is scheduled to make an approval decision on the vaccines by May, and typically follows the panel's recommendations.
“We are ready to launch without capacity or supply constraints... to supply the market that we see,” Phil Dormitzer, who oversees research & development for vaccines at GSK, said in an interview on Wednesday.

GSK has already produced much of the vaccine components it anticipates needing for that launch, mainly at its plant in Wavre, Belgium, he added.
The drugmaker published late-stage data in October showing its vaccine to be 82.6% effective in preventing lower respiratory tract disease in people aged 60 and over.
Efficacy in patients with at least two symptoms, or otherwise assessed as having severe lower respiratory disease was 94.1%.
GSK's data also showed similar efficacy in people with underlying health issues.
“I think that consistency may give us an advantage,"" Dormitzer said.
Pfizer's vaccine was 85.7% effective among participants with three or more symptoms, defined as severe lower respiratory tract illness, and 66.7% for two or more symptoms, according to an interim analysis of its pivotal clinical trial in the same age group.
Given different definitions of the trial endpoints across the GSK and Pfizer studies, a direct comparison of efficacy is difficult.
However, GSK has another possible advantage in that it has shown strong efficacy when its RSV shot is jointly administered with a flu vaccine, added Dormitzer, who joined GSK in late 2021 from Pfizer, where he helped develop and launch its COVID-19 vaccine with partner BioNTech (22UAy.DE).
Pfizer has not published data on RSV/flu co-administration.
GSK also sees China as an important future market for the vaccine, Dormitzer said. He cited “tremendous interest” in the company’s shingles vaccine Shingrix there. China contributed strongly to record Shingrix sales last year of 3 billion pounds ($3.55 billion).
GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley said in January the company is confident its RSV vaccine has ""multi-billion-pound Shingrix-like annual potential.""
The company has sought approval for the RSV vaccine in the European Union and Japan, but is yet to do so in China.
There are currently no RSV vaccines approved anywhere in the world.

The late-stage study compared patients with resectable, early-stage, non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with Imfinzi along with chemotherapy before surgery and as a monotherapy after surgery, to patients treated with chemotherapy pre-surgery.
Imfinzi was well tolerated and there were no new safety concerns before and after surgery, AstraZeneca said.
The drug had failed the main goal of a trial in patients with a form of late-stage lung cancer, Astrazeneca had said in December.
In that late-stage study, Imfinzi was tested as a monotherapy against platinum-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumour cells express high levels of PD-L1.

Castro, the country's first female president, took office last year after running on the promise of rolling back the country's restrictive reproductive policies.
Honduras, a heavily Catholic nation, banned the use and sale of the morning after pill in 2009, arguing the emergency contraception would cause abortions.
Castro opened its use to rape victims in November.
The Central American country criminalizes abortions, with those convicted facing up to six years in prison, even in cases of rape or incest.
Castro, who signed the order on International Women's Day, tweeted that the morning after pill was ""part of women's reproductive rights, and not abortive,"" citing the World Health Organization.
Hundreds of women marched through Honduras' largest cities of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula on Wednesday with demands ranging from expanded reproductive rights to ending femicides, or the killing of women due to their gender.

The year before Castro took office, Honduras' Congress passed a constitutional reform to protect anti-abortion laws, requiring a three-fourths vote to change them.
Women's and human rights groups filed more than a dozen appeals, which have so far been unsuccessful. Between 50,000 to 80,000 clandestine abortions occur each year in the country, according to a 2019 estimate from local rights groups.

""All other strengths and vial sizes are currently available to meet market demand at hospitals and beyond,"" the FDA said on Twitter.

The clearance marks the first commercially available laboratory blood test for TBI, according to the company, helping the doctors to rule out need for a CT scan in patients with mild TBI.
TBIs are caused by blow or whiplash to the head and can pose risk of short- and long-term effects that can include impairment of memory and movement.
Abbott already has a plasma test for TBI and was cleared by the FDA in 2021.
The new test measures two indicators in the blood that, in elevated concentrations, are tightly correlated to brain injury, the company said.

Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) said on Wednesday it planned to close and voluntarily liquidate, after warning last week that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern.
The California-based company, which was a key banking partner for crypto businesses, had been hit by investors rushing to withdraw around $8 billion of deposits after the sudden bankruptcy of FTX last year.
Bitcoin was last down 0.4% at $21,624 , having fallen 2.2% on Wednesday to a 3-1/2 week low of $21,590.
Investors and analysts said the market impact of the shuttering of Silvergate - seen as an important bridge between the crypto sector and traditional financial world - was limited as it had been widely expected.

Multiple partners of the bank, including major crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), severed ties with Silvergate last week. Others, including Binance, said they did not have any asset losses at Silvergate.
""Investors in bitcoin have had some time to digest this news, they are also much more focused on macro economic developments,"" said James Butterfill, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares.
""With growing doubt in the bond market over the risk of the damage further interest rate rises will do to the U.S. economy, it is supporting bitcoin prices to some extent, despite the bad news on Silvergate.""

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Crypto-focused bank Silvergate plans to wind down following blow from FTX,Hannah Lang,2023-03-09 04:37:00+00:00,,"March 8 (Reuters) - Crypto-focused bank Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N) said on Wednesday it planned to wind down operations and voluntarily liquidate after it was hit with losses following the dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX, sending its shares down 35% in after-hours trade.
The decision to shutter the bank comes after the company warned last week that it was evaluating its ability to operate as a going concern, disclosing that it had sold additional debt securities this year at a loss and that further losses mean the bank could be ""less than well capitalized.""
The dire outcome for La Jolla, California-based Silvergate, one of the crypto industry’s favored banks, shows the extent of the impact on the digital asset industry from the downfall of FTX which filed for bankruptcy in November after failing to cover customer withdrawals.
In a statement, Silvergate said the decision to wind down its bank was ""the best path forward"" in light of ""recent industry and regulatory developments."" Its wind-down and liquidation plan includes full repayment of deposits, the bank added.

Multiple partners of the bank, including high-profile firms such as Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) and Galaxy Digital, severed ties with Silvergate last week.
After Silvergate's statement, crypto exchange Coinbase said it has no client or corporate cash at Silvergate, while Binance chief Changpeng Zhao said the company did not have any asset losses at Silvergate.
Silvergate reported a $1 billion loss for the fourth quarter as investors raced to withdraw more than $8 billion in deposits.
Silvergate has retained Centerview Partners LLC as a financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP as a legal adviser, the bank said in a statement.

Founded in 1988, Silvergate ventured into crypto in 2013. The bank had also operated a mortgage warehouse business, but announced in December that it would be winding down that division, citing the rising interest rate environment and reduction in mortgage volumes.
Last week, Silvergate discontinued the Silvergate Exchange Network, its crypto payments network and one of its most popular offerings. That network enabled round-the-clock transfers between investors and crypto exchanges, unlike traditional bank wires, which can often take days to settle.
While risks of contagion are minimal, given that Silvergate has said it will repay depositors and has performing loans, the loss of the Silvergate Exchange Network is disappointing, said Ram Ahluwalia, the chief executive officer of Lumida Wealth, an investment adviser that specializes in digital assets.
""It's more of a strategic loss of critical infrastructure for crypto,"" he said.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) declined comment on Wednesday when asked about the bank's failure beyond saying that it does not regulate the bank or the holding company. Bloomberg earlier reported the FDIC had been discussing with Silvergate ways to avoid shutdown.
Federal prosecutors in Washington are probing the company and its dealings with FTX and trading firm Alameda Research. In January, three U.S. senators asked Silvergate for details about its risk management and FTX.
In a statement, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which supervised Silvergate under a state charter, said it was evaluating the bank's compliance with financial laws, as well as safety and soundness obligations, and was working with its relevant federal counterparts.
More than a trillion dollars in value were wiped out from the crypto sector in 2022 with rising interest rates exacerbating worries of an economic downturn.
After rapid growth in 2020 and 2021, bitcoin - the most popular digital currency by far - fell more than 60% last year, pressuring the digital assets industry.

Celsius attorney Chris Koenig said at a hearing in bankruptcy court in Manhattan that the company remains open to better offers, and that it and its creditors committee met with a potential buyer two days ago to review an alternate proposal.
At the hearing, the New Jersey-based lender asked U.S. bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn, who is overseeing Celsius' Chapter 11, for more time to submit a bankruptcy restructuring plan built around the NovaWulf deal, which would cash out customers with less than $5,000 in crypto deposits and hand ownership of the company's remaining assets to customers with larger accounts.
Glenn agreed to give Celsius an extra three weeks to file a Chapter 11 plan.

With NovaWulf's offer in hand, Celsius should be able to exit from bankruptcy by June, less than a year after it filed for Chapter 11, Koenig said.
If Celsius chooses an alternate bidder, Koenig said, it intends to offer NovaWulf up to $20 million in breakup fees.
""If there is a higher offer, it will be because of the floor set by NovaWulf,"" Koenig said.
NovaWulf declined to comment on Celsius's solicitation of other bids.
Crypto lenders such as Celsius boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic, but many companies in the highly interconnected sector went bankrupt in 2022.
Celsius filed for U.S. bankruptcy in July after freezing customer withdrawals. Celsius said at the time that it had more than 1.7 million registered users and approximately 300,000 active users with account balances greater than $100.

The Financial Conduct Authority's new chair Ashley Alder said rules for crypto should be just as tough as for risky activities in mainstream finance. Britain plans to regulate crypto under a new financial services law this year.
A regulatory regime the same as for conventional finance would see crypto business models change radically, Alder said.
""One of the questions in my mind is when you put in place a regulatory framework around crypto, the interesting aspect is the degree to which crypto will need to adapt and effectively detoxify to fit into that regime,"" he added.
Some 85% of crypto firms who applied for permission to operate in Britain were rejected by the FCA because they could not comply with basic anti-money laundering safeguards.

Some firms in the sector were evasive, with near deliberate multiple conflicts of interest and huge issues around proper safeguarding of customer assets, Alder told parliament's Treasury Select Committee.
Regulators have taken a harder line on the sector have a crash in bitcoin values, and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX highlighted how many activities were conducted under one roof without safeguards.
The FCA and police have also swooped on suspect illegal crypto cashpoints in London to protect consumers.
Alder was asked by lawmakers to respond to a letter from his predecessor, Charles Randell, to the committee in which he said that ""speculative crypto is gambling pure and simple"", and should be regulated and taxed as such, with levies to support debt advice and addiction services.
""If the issue and trading of speculative crypto are instead treated as financial services, conferring the 'halo' of financial services regulation, then increased consumer loss and calls for compensation provided by taxpayers or financial services levy payers will inevitably follow,"" Randell wrote.

Future of Money,/business/future-of-money/,Cryptoverse: New breed of bitcoin NFTs sell for millions,Lisa Pauline Mattackal,2023-03-14 11:10:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/O4MQBAQY2VKZ7N3LSPEFR75MPQ.jpg,"March 14 (Reuters) - Imagine digitally inscribing 3D images of objects such as multi-colored spheres onto a tiny fragment of bitcoin. Then imagine selling them for $16.5 million.
Just when you thought crypto couldn't get any stranger, bitcoin accidentally births a new breed of NFTs.
The new entrants have materialized in 2023 following bitcoin network upgrades that enabled each satoshi - the smallest denomination of bitcoin, or one hundred millionth - to store a few megabytes of data, from text and images to audio and video.
The data storage was an unintended consequence of the upgrades. Now crypto enthusiasts have embedded a total of 385,000 ""inscriptions"" known as Ordinals on bitcoin since January, including more than 200,000 image files and over 150,000 text ones, according to Glassnode Market Intelligence.
""I think this is really the start of a fundamental shift in what you can do with bitcoin,"" said Alex Miller, CEO at bitcoin developer network Hiro.

The colored balls form part of TwelveFold, a collection of 300 images of 3D objects rendered in a square grid, from NFT developers Yuga Labs, best known for its Bored Ape Yacht Club. It calls the set ""a visual allegory"" for data on blockchain.
They became a lucrative allegory this month when the company auctioned 288 of them off for $16.5 million, according to data from research firm Delphi Digital.
Other top-selling Ordinals - named after the software protocol that facilitates inscription - include JPEGs of rocks and shadowy crowned figures which have sold for $213,845 and $273,010 respectively, according to Galaxy Digital Research.
Although the market for bitcoin NFTs has only been going since January, Galaxy estimates it could be worth $4.5 billion by 2025, basing its bullish forecast on factors such as the growth of the more established Ethereum NFT market and the fact that bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency.
Caveat emptor, though: Little can be accurately foreseen in the highly unpredictable market for non-fungible tokens, it would appear.
Overall sales of NFTs - excluding Ordinals - stood at about $1 billion last month, according to CryptoSlam data, a recovery from the $324 million in November but still a fraction of the roughly $5 billion seen last January and $2.7 billion in May.
Nonetheless, bitcoin NFTs have built up a head of steam in a short space of time. Satoshis inscribed with NFTs are involved in about 7% of the total number of bitcoin blockchain transactions, according to Glassnode data.
One of the biggest challenges for this new class of NFTs is the dearth of a user-friendly marketplaces, with early transactions taking place over-the-counter on shared online spreadsheets, according to market players.
This lack of infrastructure is a definite barrier to entry, Delphi Digital said.
Not everyone is happy about this surge of activity, especially some bitcoin purists who believe the cryptocurrency should solely be used for payments.
The average fee to make a bitcoin transaction, measured over a 7-day period, has spiked to $1.981, its highest since November, as Ordinals trading surged compared with under $1 at the start of February, according to data from Blockchain.com.
""We want transactions to remain as inexpensive as possible so people around the world can run businesses and send money,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of bitcoin-focused financial services firm Swan Bitcoin, who sees problems in ""having it priced out through this non-monetary use case that's kind of frivolous"".
Some critics say Ordinals are also clogging up the network; the 7-day average of time to confirm bitcoin transactions spiked to over 186 minutes in late February, its highest since November's bitcoin selloff, according to Blockchain.com.
That's since dropped to over 124 minutes, though that's still significantly longer than the range of 12.8 to 35 minutes transaction time in January and February.
""Ordinals have brought some more eyes to the network,"" said Brendon Sedo, a developer at the Core DAO blockchain. ""But NFTs on bitcoin are a distraction from the network's core purpose, which is to serve as a permissionless network that is globally available, 24/7, and uncensorable.""

It is part of wider efforts to have more women and people from modest social backgrounds in top corporate and financial roles.
The committee said that in 2022, 96 of the FTSE 100 companies met a target of at least one minority ethnic director on their boards, with 49 having more than one minority ethnic director, effectively meeting a goal it set in 2017.
Ethnic minorities now account for 190 of the 1,064 board positions at FTSE 100 companies, 31 as chairs or executive directors.
The next tier down of 250 listed companies are making progress towards a 2024 deadline of one minority ethnic director, with 67% meeting the target last year, the committee said.

""There’s still more to do however, and the Parker Review’s recommendations clearly set out how companies must improve diversity from top to bottom in the coming years, so they can make the most of untapped talent available and ensure British boardrooms are truly reflective of British society,"" business minister Nusrat Ghani said in a statement.
The new targets call on each of the top 350 listed companies to also set a percentage target for senior management positions by December 2027.
In addition, 50 of the largest unlisted companies, such as law firm Allen & Overy, auditor Deloitte, retailer John Lewis Partnership, Virgin Atlantic and Thames Water have been asked to have at least one ethnic minority director by December 2027.
""We have long argued that companies benefit from ensuring that succession planning and management development plans include the development of ethnic minority executives,"" committee chair David Tyler said.

Two union officials had told Reuters that the British telecoms giant was looking to slim down its Italian unit as part of a larger cost saving plan.
Vodafone Italia said in a statement it is looking to cut 1,000 jobs after a fall in revenues and margins resulting from ""extraordinary competitive pressure"" in the telecoms sector.
The company shared the news in a meeting with unions in which it informed them of the need for a ""radical simplification"" of operations.
As of last March, Vodafone's workforce in Italy totalled 5,765 employees, according to the group's latest annual report.

World at Work,/business/world-at-work/,Deutsche Post says it agrees wage deal with union to avoid strike,Reuters,2023-03-11 17:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/4WJ4PCICQ5NJXA5KOWWKDVLXMM.jpg,"DUESSELDORF, Germany, March 11 (Reuters) - Germany's Deutsche Post postal company (DPWGn.DE) said on Saturday it had agreed a wage deal with the Verdi trade union that would enable it to avoid an indefinite strike threatened by unionised workers.
The offer - which members still need to vote on - would give Deutsche Post's 160,000 employees in Germany a one-off payment of 3,000 euros over 15 months and raises monthly wages by 340 euros from April 1, 2024, the company said in a statement.
That means wages will rise in total by 11.5% on average, with salaries for workers in lower-paid brackets set to increase by more than 20%.
The deal could set a new precedent after unions in other sectors in Europe's largest economy such as the metal and electrical or chemical and pharmaceutical industries recently agreed wage hikes well below inflation.
Some 86% of members of the services sector trade union Verdi had voted on Thursday to reject a previous wage offer prompting a new round of negotiating.

Brisk inflation and widespread labour shortages are emboldening unions in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to demand double-digit wage hikes this year.
Verdi called earlier on Saturday for strikes on March 13 at the country's northern airports, including Berlin, which it said would likely cause longer queues for passengers and flight cancellations.
German consumer prices rose by 9.3% on the year in February.

Meta let go of 11,000 employees four months ago and would be the first Big Tech company to announce a second round of mass layoffs.
The first wave of the new cuts would be announced next week and are likely to hit non-engineering roles the hardest, according to the report.
The company is also expected to shut down some projects and teams in conjunction with these cuts, the report added.

Asian Markets,/markets/asia/,Morning Bid: Markets now banking on no more Fed hikes,Jamie McGeever,2023-03-13 21:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/4XA7LAMSXZKY7JLT4RYXABINQ4.jpg,"March 14 (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets from Jamie McGeever.
After the crash, bang, and wallop of two U.S. banks collapsing and regulators steaming in with emergency measures late on Sunday to prevent contagion from sweeping through markets, the sound you hear now is the screech of economists and investors reversing on their Fed forecasts.
If the ratcheting up of U.S. rate expectations in the last few months was almost without precedent, the complete turnaround in the last few days is truly historic.
A week ago Barclays economists raised their forecast for the Fed's March 21-22 meeting to a 50 basis point rate hike from 25 bps. On Monday, they changed that to zero.
Rates futures markets show traders now reckon the Fed is done raising rates and will cut by 50 bps later this year. The implied 'terminal' rate has plunged more than 100 bps since last week to 4.35%, and the year-end implied rate has plummeted more than 150 bps to 3.90%.

The two-year Treasury yield's slide of around 65 bps since Thursday marks the biggest three-day fall since the Black Monday crash in 1987.
So how will Asian markets open on Tuesday? Equity investors are essentially being pulled in the opposite direction by two competing, and powerful forces.
On one hand, huge stress in the U.S. banking system, the collapse of the country's 16th largest bank and emergency intervention from the Fed, Treasury and FDIC to prevent contagion is a screaming sell signal. U.S. banking stocks tanked 7%, their biggest fall in almost three years.
On the other, swift and bold intervention, the most stunning collapse in bond yields and implied interest rates, a sharply weaker dollar, and expectations that the Fed's tightening campaign is over has clearly tempted a lot of buyers.
World stocks fell on Monday and are now down five days in a row, the longest losing streak since October. But Wall Street was mixed - the Dow and S&P 500 ended down 0.3% and 0.15%, respectively, while the Nasdaq rose 0.45%.
Hong Kong tech stocks broke a five-day losing streak to jump 3% on Monday, and the Nasdaq's resilience may provide a springboard for further upside on Tuesday. The weaker dollar and sharply lower U.S. yields could also lead to broader support.
But the dust has almost certainly not settled yet, especially if U.S. inflation figures on Tuesday come in hotter than expected.
Here are three key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Tuesday:
- U.S. CPI inflation (February)
- India wholesale inflation (February)
- South Korea central bank minutes

Commodities,/markets/commodities/,"United States, EU agree to start talks on critical minerals amid trade tensions",Jeff Mason,2023-03-10 22:22:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Amid trade frictions between the United States and the European Union, President Joe Biden and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed on Friday that the two sides would launch talks on critical minerals used for electric vehicles.
Biden and von der Leyen met at the White House against a backdrop of European complaints that clean energy subsidies in the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and others will divert investment away from Europe and hurt their economies. The war in Ukraine was also a major agenda item.
Biden's IRA, a $430 billion law that offers massive subsidies for U.S.-made products and is aimed at addressing the climate crisis and promoting renewable energy, has prompted European anger. EU officials say allies should stick together and form a common front against bigger threats from China.
The Biden administration has sought to address European concerns while sticking to the core tenets of the law, which represented a major domestic political victory for Biden upon its passage.

In a joint statement after their meeting, the two leaders said they intended to ""immediately begin negotiations on a targeted critical minerals agreement"" to ensure that minerals extracted or processed in the EU would count for clean vehicle tax credits under the IRA law.
""This kind of agreement would further our shared goals of boosting our mineral production and processing and expanding access to sources of critical minerals that are sustainable, trusted, and free of labor abuses,"" they said in the statement. ""Cooperation is also necessary to reduce unwanted strategic dependencies in these supply chains, and to ensure that they are diversified and developed with trusted partners.""
Speaking in the Oval Office at the start of the meeting, both Biden and von der Leyen underlined the strength of their partnership, and the unified support for Ukraine and efforts to hold Russia accountable for its invasion.

""We are not only partners, the European Union and the United States are good friends,"" von der Leyen said, highlighting U.S. support for Europe in finding alternate energy supplies so EU members could reduce their dependence on Russian supplies.
""We supported Europe’s energy security,"" Biden said. ""And at the same time, we're driving new investments to create clean energy industries and jobs, and make sure we have supply chains available to both ... our continents.""
The European Commission last month presented its Green Deal Industrial Plan in response to the U.S. IRA law, with increased levels of state aid to help Europe compete as a manufacturing hub for clean tech products.
Biden said the idea of driving investments and securing supply chains underpinned both measures.
Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a corporate lobby group, urged the White House to raise U.S. industry concerns on what he called a ""discriminatory digital sovereignty agenda"" aimed at undermining U.S. companies.
""A level transatlantic playing field is critical but that has to go both ways, he said. ""The White House needs to step up and underscore the need for American companies to be regulated in the same manner as their European counterparts when operating on the other side of the Atlantic.""
During a December visit by France's President Emmanuel Macron to the White House, Biden said that bills aimed at boosting U.S. renewable energy and the semiconductor industry have ""glitches"" that can be addressed.

Commodities,/markets/commodities/,Black Sea grain talks continue as Russia seeks 60-day renewal,Reuters,2023-03-14 11:58:00+00:00,,"MOSCOW, March 14 (Reuters) - Talks continue to extend a deal to allow grain shipments from Ukraine's Black Sea ports ahead of a deadline later this week, the United Nations and Turkey said on Tuesday, after Kyiv rejected a Russian push for a reduced 60-day renewal.
Since Russia and Ukraine signed the U.N.-backed Black Sea Grain Initiative in Turkey on July 22, millions of tonnes of grain and other food products have been exported from Ukrainian ports, helping to lower global food prices from record highs.
After Russia on Monday suggested allowing the deal to be renewed for 60 days, half the term of the previous renewal, the TASS news agency cited Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko as saying on Tuesday that a deal had been agreed for a 60-day extension.

Turkey, which facilitated the deal alongside the U.N., said in a defence ministry statement that Moscow had agreed to back a 60-day extension to the deal but that talks continued.
A U.N. spokesperson said ""informal dialogue"" between the organisation and parties to the deal continued, though in-person talks with Russia had ended in Geneva.
Ukraine said it will stick to the terms of the previously agreed deal based on a 120-day duration that can be renewed.
""We will follow the agreement strictly,"" a senior Ukrainian government official told Reuters. The official declined to be identified.
The Kremlin later repeated previous Russian criticism of the deal that it does not address obstacles to its own food and fertiliser exports, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the deal could not ""stand on one leg"".
Russia has said that, although the West has not explicitly targeted its agricultural exports, sanctions on its payments, logistics and insurance industries have created barriers.
As grain markets have anticipated an extension of the Black Sea agreement after the current term expires on March 18, U.S. and European wheat futures , have fallen to their lowest in over a year in recent days, with future market direction hanging on news of any deal, traders said.
""Investment funds think that if there is no halt to the corridor, then supply remains healthy. But they're very short in wheat and if there's a problem, they may have to rush to cover positions,"" a European trader said on condition of anonymity.

Tuesday's consumer price index (CPI) figures, due out at 8.30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT), have the potential to drive further volatility in global markets. They come a day after fears of a potential banking crisis caused traders to rapidly scale down their expectations for Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Globally, turmoil in markets following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank has caused market pricing for central banks' rate outlooks to move dramatically in the last few sessions, and there is a now a 25% chance the Fed leaves rates unchanged at its next meeting, according to CME's Fedwatch tool.
Previously a 25 basis point (bps) hike was firmly priced in and there was a reasonable chance of 50 bps.
That has led to the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six main peers, to fall from a high of 105.88 on Wednesday, March 8 to 103.47 on Tuesday. It was last at 103.75.

He said currency markets would also be watching U.S. consumer price data due later in the day. ""The CPI report is still important, but it's dependent on financial risks abating,"" he said. ""If they do abate, we'll be talking about this CPI data in a few weeks time.""

Public sector lenders (.NIFTYPSU) were among the top drags, falling 1.9%, even as analysts dispelled concerns saying Indian lenders were insulated from the U.S. banking crisis. IT stocks (.NIFTYIT) fell 1.7%, while autos (.NIFTYAUTO) dropped 0.9%.
Indian IT service provider Infosys Ltd (INFY.NS) hit a five-month low, while private lender Bandhan Bank Ltd (BANH.NS) slumped to a 3-year trough.

Sainsbury's, Britain's second largest grocer after Tesco (TSCO.L), has held a 49% interest in Highbury and Dragon, which comprises the freeholds of 26 stores leased to Sainsbury's, since it was created in 2000.
The deal will result in Sainsbury's buying the freeholds of 21 stores which will continue to be operated as Sainsbury's supermarkets.
The remaining five stores will be sold by Sainsbury's, four of which it will lease back.
Sainsbury's has also agreed to fully fund Highbury and Dragon's bond redemptions of 170.5 million pounds on March 20 and 130.4 million pounds on July 13.

The deal builds on an existing co-promotion agreement between the two companies, and would give the French drugmaker full ownership of the drug, Tzield, Sanofi said, adding it expects to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of 2023.
While growth in asthma and eczema drug Dupixent is boosting Sanofi's sales, investors have criticised its drug development pipeline as weak.
Provention Bio's shares nearly quadrupled in premarket trade from their last close at $6.70 after Sanofi agreed to buy the company at $25 per share in cash.
""The speed of the acquisition, combined with the large premium, suggests a competitive process, whereby Sanofi may have needed to respond to an unsolicited bid from another pharma (company),"" SMBC Nikko Securities America analyst David Hoang said in an email.

Shares of Sanofi were down 1.5% in afternoon trade in Paris.
Sanofi, the maker of long acting insulin products Toujeo and Lantus for type 2 diabetes, in 2019 quit further type 2 diabetes drug development.
Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson said last month the company saw great promise in type 1 diabetes drug development and reaffirmed his commitment to steer clear of further work on type 2 diabetes and obesity.
U.S.-based biotech firm Provention Bio won approval in the United States last year for Tzield, making it the first drug indicated to delay the onset of the third and final stage of type 1 diabetes in adults and children aged 8 years and older at stage 2.

Deals,/markets/deals/,China battery giant CATL's $5 bln Swiss listing delayed amid Beijing regulatory concerns - sources,Scott Murdoch,2023-03-14 08:44:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EVX5BNVCFZM6RPTUMUDL5HP54I.jpg,"HONG KONG, March 14 (Reuters) - Chinese battery giant CATL's plan to raise at least $5 billion in Swiss global depository receipts (GDR) has been delayed as Beijing regulators raise concerns over the large scale of the offering, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The world's largest battery maker, formally known as Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) (300750.SZ), had expected to receive a green light for the listing in Zurich from the Chinese securities regulator by the end of January, said one of the sources. But the process is taking longer than expected, all three sources told Reuters.
The delay has come to light a week after Chinese President Xi Jinping told CATL that he had mixed feelings about its status as the biggest player in a soaring business tracking the rise of electric vehicles around the world. Xi's comments came in a rare public intervention about one of China's most globally competitive sectors.  read more 
In a response to a presentation by CATL's chairman Robin Zeng on the sidelines of China's annual parliament meeting last week, Xi was quoted by official media as saying that he was ""both happy and worried"" - glad about CATL's industry-leading position, but concerned about the risks as the company expands rapidly overseas and moves to undercut domestic rivals.

CATL, worth about $139 billion by market value and now expanding in Germany and the United States, already controls 37% of the global battery market, according to its 2022 annual report. It supplies auto giants like Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE).
The company has told the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), whose approval for the listing is required, that it plans to use the proceeds to fund its European expansion plans, especially the development of a plant in Hungary, one source said, and potentially also finance its expansion in the United States.
In early February, sources said CATL aimed to go ahead with the listing as early as May. There is no new timetable for the deal to proceed, according to the sources, who said they could not be named as they were discussing private information.
The CSRC did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters.
CATL did not respond to a request for comment.
The sources said the Chinese regulator has concerns over the vast scale of CATL's GDR offering.
The CSRC is also examining CATL's planned use of proceeds, sources said, adding the regulator has questioned the battery maker's need to raise so much money after it raised 45 billion yuan ($6.56 billion) in a jumbo domestic share placement in June.
The company said at the time proceeds raised in the placement will be used to fund the production and upgrades of lithium-ion batteries in four Chinese cities, and enhance research and development.
The private placement was the biggest equity capital market transaction in China last year and the second largest follow-on deal globally in 2020, according to Dealogic data.
At $5 billion, the GDR deal would easily be the largest such listing by a Chinese company in Switzerland, according to Refinitiv data.
Chinese companies began listing in Switzerland last year after the launch of cross-listing platform to allow companies to raise capital by issuing and listing GDRs on the Swiss exchange SIX. Swiss companies can issue Chinese Depository Receipts on the Chinese exchanges.
GDRs are one fundraising option used by companies to offer investors outside the firms' home bases a chance to buy and trade the stock on shareholders' local exchanges.
Offshore investors are attracted to Chinese issuers' GDRs as they can generally buy the shares with a 10% discount and freely convert them into corresponding Chinese shares after 120 days of trading on European boards. With much better liquidity on the domestic market, investors can exit more easily.
But when investors transfer the capital from onshore to offshore, it consumes some of China's foreign exchange reserves, while issuers usually keep the proceeds raised for overseas use. Such practices have also made Chinese regulators less keen to wave through mega-GDR offerings, two of the sources with knowledge of the matter said.

European Markets,/markets/europe/,Morning Bid: Ready or not! Here comes US inflation data,Reuters,2023-03-14 05:35:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HBITBSDZBNKG7GJUNOPCA7R4RQ.jpg,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee
Investors are struggling to find their risk appetite this week, with markets jittery in the wake of the stunning collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and measures by U.S. authorities to stem contagion risks.
And yet, global banking stocks have been brutally hit, with Japanese banks sinking to their lowest in nearly three months on Tuesday. The dollar remains pinned near a one-month low, while oil prices fell more than $1 and MSCI ex-Japan index languishing at more than two month lows. And while the two-year U.S. Treasury yield was up 16 basis points at 4.109% on Tuesday, it remained far off last week's high of 5.085%.
All of that means that the market is ready to believe the Fed may just stay pat and not hike next week, with peak rates not far off. Traders are even pricing in rate cuts by the end of the year, a far cry from expectations last week of interest rates staying above 5% through 2023.
The tentativeness might not pass through to Europe, though, as futures indicate stocks might be in for a higher open. Whether they sustain any gains remains to be seen. Investors will be keen to see if the worst is over for European banking stocks, with eyes on the STOXX banking index, which clocked its biggest one-day percentage drop in a year on Monday.

The spotlight will be firmly on U.S. inflation data for February, due later in the day, when consumer prices are seen to have risen at a solid pace, but economists are divided on whether the data will be enough to push the Fed Reserve to hike rates again next week.

Interest rate futures suggested the likelihood of no change in Bank Rate on March 23 was about 40% at 0813 GMT having been close to 50% earlier in the session. Last week, the chance of a BoE rate hike pause was seen at around 10%.
Bets on a quarter-percentage point rate hike stood at about 60% on Tuesday.
Expectations about a Federal Reserve rate hike this month have also fallen sharply after the collapse of SVB.

Germany's 2-year yield was down by as much as 27 basis points (bps) to 2.425% in early trade, its lowest since Jan. 19. It later pared those gains, leaving the yield up 9 bps at 2.789%.
The 2-year yield, which is highly sensitive to ECB interest rate expectations, stood above 3.3% last week.
""There is a hope that this is a crisis that is not going to spread further,"" said Daniel Lenz, rates strategist at DZ Bank.
""For as long as there is no more bad news, you will see a reversal in government bonds and that's the reason for this counter movement,"" Lenz said, although he warned this could change rapidly if there were other signs of stress in the banking system.
The SVB collapse triggered a mammoth rally in global bond markets on Monday, which saw the biggest one-day decline in the 2-year Treasury yield since 1987, of 56 bps. Yields move inversely to prices.

On Sunday, U.S. regulators took measures to stem the consequences of the bank's collapse and shore up confidence in the banking system, but markets are assuming interest rates will increase less than previously thought.
Traders are currently fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate hike at Thursday's ECB policy meeting and around a 60% chance of a larger half-point move. On Monday a 25 basis point hike was the most likely outcome.
Traders had priced in a 50 basis point hike with near certainty last week, while the terminal rate is expected to be around 3.4% in October this year, from above 4% previously.
""It seems that the ECB will try to convince markets that they are calm and there's no reason to change the policy stance. That would speak in favour of a 50 basis point hike,"" DZ Bank's Lenz said.
A market gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the euro zone fell as low as 2.3514%, close to its lowest level since Feb. 9. It reached 2.6083% on March 6.
Markets have also lowered monetary policy tightening expectations for the Federal Reserve, with futures pricing in policy easing as early as July.
Nomura analysts even forecast the Fed will cut rates at next week's meeting as policymakers assess financial stability risks. Previously, they expected the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points.
""While the Fed might become more dovish in the short term, we don't believe this will happen with the ECB, at least during this week's policy meeting,"" Massimiliano Maxia, a senior fixed-income specialist at Allianz Global Investors, said.
""We didn't change our forecasts, and we expect the ECB to raise rates by 50 bps on Thursday and be data-dependent from then on.""
Germany's 10-year yield , the euro area benchmark, was last up 7 basis points at 2.351%, having hit a 5-week low of 2.168% on Monday.
Italy's 10-year yield rose 2 basis points to 4.238%.
The closely-watched spread between German and Italian 10-year yields earlier widened to around 197.5 basis points, its widest level since Feb. 2.
The index of bond market volatility (.MOVE) hit its highest level in 14 years on Monday.
With volatility spiking, analysts said Tuesday's U.S. consumer prices data is likely to have less impact than expected last week.
""In case of another nasty upward surprise, the market response might be more muted than it would otherwise have been,"" UniCredit analysts said in a note.
""In contrast, a miss of consensus expectations on the soft side might add to the recent bull run in bonds,"" they added.

Instead, investors now see a roughly 5% chance of a bigger 0.50 percentage point hike on March 23.
The re-pricing follows Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comment overnight that the United States may need to raise interest rates more than expected in response to recent strong data. The dollar surged against the pound after Powell's remarks.
The yield on the interest rate-sensitive 0.625% 2025 British government bond - which became the benchmark two-year gilt at the start of the month - rose to its highest level since Oct. 21.

U.S. Markets,/markets/us/,Fintech firms may struggle to find investor love in rebounding U.S. IPO market,Manya Saini,2023-03-09 04:24:00+00:00,,"March 8 (Reuters) - The once high-flying fintech startups looking to go public will have a hard time attracting investor attention, even though a freeze that has gripped the market for new listings is starting to thaw.
Activities related to initial public offerings (IPO) in the United States came to a standstill for more than a year as the U.S. Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary-tightening policy sucked out easy money from the system.
The cautious mood in the market has meant that mostly those startups that are backed by solid fundamentals and steady revenue streams have dared to go public, with roughly 24 companies listing their shares this year and about 140 filing for IPOs.
As investor confidence improves, more companies are expected to reignite their IPO plans this year, but fintech firms may opt out of the race as they face a string of worries, including rising cash-burn rate, mounting losses and poor share performance of some of their listed peers.

""We're still in the early innings of the IPO market's pick-up. And when IPO activity does resume, we expect fintechs will likely be among the last to rejoin the party,"" said Matthew Kennedy, senior strategist at IPO research firm Renaissance Capital.
""I don't think it would surprise anyone if they all sat out the 2023 IPO market,"" Kennedy added.
Digital banking pioneers Chime and Stripe are currently seen as the industry's top IPO candidates along with investing app Acorns and buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna.
Fintech apps soared in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a near-zero interest rate environment helped them offer easy credit to lure consumers who were stuck at home.
Digital payments giants like PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) and Block Inc (SQ.N) also expanded their buy now, pay later (BNPL) services to appeal to millennials and Gen Z customers.
But with interest rates at their highest levels since the global financial crisis, apps with huge exposure to subprime borrowers have attracted investor scrutiny, making it tough for such startups to justify higher valuations.
""On the fintech side, it is not one-size-fits-all. Fintechs that have maintained their growth and market share focus may not play well into the current market focus on profitability,"" said Rachel Gerring, EY Americas IPO leader, and Mark Schwartz, IPO and SPAC Capital Markets Advisory leader.
They, however, said there were companies in the sector with the scale and cash flow for whom individual circumstances would determine whether to push forward with their IPO plans or opt for a wait-and-see approach.
In the IPO boom of 2021, 20 fintech companies raised a combined $10.93 billion, vastly overshadowing the $144 million that was raised by a lone offering in the following year, according to data from Dealogic.
""The IPO market is not closed, but it's certainly more valuation and profitability focused,"" said David Ethridge, U.S. co-IPO leader at global consulting giant PwC.
Companies looking to list will need to shore up investor confidence in their cost-cutting plans and be transparent with their attempts to lower cash burn, he added.
Listed fintech companies have failed to largely live up to their shareholders' expectations as they have steadily booked losses, leading to a string of routs in their shares.
Coinbase, which was valued at $86 billion in its Nasdaq debut in April 2021, now has a market capitalization of about $15 billion.
Robinhood and BNPL lender Affirm Holdings (AFRM.O) have shed $20 billion each in valuations since going public.
High-growth fintechs were previously valued like tech companies, where valuation was decided as a multiple of sales. But with the tech boom having subsided, they are being evaluated using the playbook investors use for financial firms, where earnings play a crucial role, Renaissance's Kennedy said.

U.S. Markets,/markets/us/,A new surprise for U.S. savers: Turn 529s into retirement money,Chris Taylor,2023-03-14 04:17:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/DI2XV5TEVROTPC4VI6UHK63VOA.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - When financial planner Larry Pon started reading about the SECURE 2.0 Act that overhauls retirement saving, he was shocked at the provision about college funds.
""Hey, this applies to me!"" the certified public accountant from Redwood Shores, California, said.
The new legislation lets savers roll over unused funds from their kids' 529 college-savings plans into a Roth IRA. As it happened, Pon's daughter graduated from the University of California-Berkeley with a degree in sociology, and the family had money left over.
The change caught Pon by surprise.
""It gave us more options – and boy, did the phone start ringing from clients,"" he said.
No wonder: money in 529 accounts is typically trapped, in a sense, since taking funds back out for non-educational purposes usually results in heavy taxes and penalties.
But starting in 2024, up to $35,000 in 529 funds can be redirected into a Roth IRA penalty-free. Of course, there are plenty of rules and caveats involved, and some analysts said the legislation does not go far enough. But at least it is a start.

""It's the first step of a smart 529 expansion,"" said Andrea Feirstein, a New York City-based college savings expert and founder of AKF Consulting. ""Maybe this provision gives parents some comfort, to know that excess money could be used in future for their child's retirement.""
In 2022, around $2.6 billion was taken out of 529 plans as non-qualified distributions (meaning, not used for educational expenses), according to ISS Market Intelligence.
In most cases, the penalties for non-qualified distributions are pretty stiff: Earnings are taxable, plus there is a 10% withdrawal penalty.
Such restrictions explain why some savers have been hesitant about committing to 529s – and why SECURE 2.0 could help change their minds. Here are factors to consider:
This program has several parameters and running afoul of them could be expensive. A few key ones: The $35,000 figure is the total maximum, but the annual amount you are allowed to roll over is limited to $6,500. The funds cannot be directed towards just any Roth IRA, but only to one in the name of the account beneficiary.
This takes effect at the beginning of 2024, so for the moment, previous rules still apply. Also, the 529 plan needs to have been in existence for at least 15 years, and the funds being rolled over cannot have been contributed within the last five.
Even if your child graduated college, the money can be used for future education. Perhaps they will decide to go to grad school. Or maybe they have a younger sibling, and the beneficiary can be changed.
Looking even further in the future, that money could be redirected for the education of a grandchild, who presumably will benefit from account growth over a longer timeline.
It could even benefit the parents.
""Here's another consideration, that we could change the beneficiary to me, and I can use the money for my own education,"" Pon said. ""I just got a brochure for a summer course at Oxford University, learning about Shakespeare.""
Starting a retirement plan as early as possible – in your 20s, say, as opposed to your 30s or 40s – makes a massive difference to the eventual total. The Catch-22 is that most young people starting out have little money to put away.
This is where this new rollover rule could have significant long-term effects. For a 25-year-old, a $35,000 initial sum compounded at 7% annually over 40 years would mean that they are looking at over a half million dollars by age 65, even if they never contributed another dime.
As a result, these new 529 rules might mean that parents need not be as nervous about money getting trapped.
""Many parents and grandparents are worried about overfunding their 529 plans,"" said Mitchell Kraus, a financial planner in Santa Monica, California. ""This will ease some concerns, as excess money can be used for future generations' retirement.""
It is also great for estate planning.
""Being able to convert excess funds to a Roth allows a parent or grandparent to make a tax-free gift that will benefit future generations decades later,"" Kraus added.

U.S. Markets,/markets/us/,Factbox: Key elements of Fed's new US bank funding program,Reuters,2023-03-13 11:21:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BXPBJPNASZNX5BH4U7TNO2MFQ4.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Sunday unveiled a new program to ensure banks can meet the needs of all their depositors amid escalating chances of bank runs following the abrupt collapse of two major banks in the space of 72 hours.
The Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) will offer loans with maturities of up to a year to banks, savings associations, credit unions and other eligible depository institutions.
Here are some key elements of the Fed's program:
The Fed has raised rates from near zero a year ago to between 4.50-4.75% now to combat inflation that hit a 40-year high last year.
That has undercut bond prices, including those for older-vintage Treasuries held widely by banks, which proved a major factor in Silicon Valley Bank's inability to raise funds and contributed to its demise. Officials worry others could soon follow.
""The BTFP will be an additional source of liquidity against high-quality securities, eliminating an institution's need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress,"" the Fed said in a statement on Sunday.

A key element of the program is acceptable loan collateral - including U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities among others - will be valued at ""par,"" meaning open-market bond values that have been impaired by a year of Fed rate hikes will not reduce what a bank may borrow from the central bank.
The same collateral terms will also be available for loans drawn from the Fed's ""discount window,"" its traditional lender-of-last-resort facility. Ordinarily, loan amounts were governed by the market value of the pledged collateral.
""This will allow banks to fund potential deposit outflows Without crystalizing losses on depreciated securities,"" Goldman Sachs wrote Sunday after the Fed announcement.
Loans of up to a year in length will be available under the new facility. Borrowers may prepay the loans without penalty. Advances can be made until March 11, 2024.
Interest rates will be the one-year overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 10 basis points and will be fixed for the term of the advance on the day the advance is made.
That OIS rate was quoted at about 4.9% late Sunday following the Fed's announcement, according to Refinitiv data, down from as high as 5.6% last week before Silicon Valley's difficulties emerged and started driving rates lower.
The loan commitments made by the Fed's 12 regional banks will be backstopped with $25 billion from the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund. The Fed said it does not expect to have to tap those funds because the loans under the program are full recourse, meaning the central bank can seize all of the pledged collateral in the event of a failure to repay.
In fact, the Fed loans are made with ""recourse beyond the pledged collateral,"" which takes into account the fact that the collateral may be impaired.
That suggests ""that the par valuation of the collateral would only become relevant if the borrowing institution lacks sufficient assets to repay the loan,"" Goldman wrote.
""One of the biggest revelations about the failure of Silicon Valley Bank to raise capital last week was the impact of the cumulative increase in interest rates over the last year on their securities portfolios,"" Jefferies economists wrote after the details were released.
""Because the pledged collateral is going to be valued at par, this new facility will ensure that other banks with similarly impaired hold-to-maturity portfolios will be able to easily leverage them to access liquidity, rather than have to realize significant losses and flood the markets with paper.""
""Monday will surely be a stressful day for many in the regional banking sector, but today's action dramatically reduces the risk of further contagion,"" they said.

U.S. Markets,/markets/us/,Sliding bank shares drag Wall Street down in choppy trade,David Carnevali,2023-03-13 23:12:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Sliding bank shares dragged Wall Street down on Monday with investors worried about contagion from the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, but trade was choppy and the Nasdaq composite actually ended higher as some sectors benefited from hopes the Federal Reserve could ease up on interest rates hikes.
SVB Financial's (SIVB.O) sudden shutdown on Friday after a failed capital raise had investors worried about risks to other banks from the Fed's sharp rate hikes over the last year. But many speculated the central bank could now become less hawkish, and the yield on the 2-year Treasury tumbled.
Regulators over the weekend stepped in to restore investor confidence in the banking system, saying SVB's depositors will have access to their funds on Monday.
To some investors, the Fed's decision next week will also hinge on inflation data due this week.

U.S. Markets,/markets/us/,Wall Street pushes back against SEC stock market reforms,John Mccrank,2023-03-06 22:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HOENRXT2VRLQPDL7JPBS6LPMEE.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange teamed up with retail broker Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW.N) and market maker Citadel Securities on Monday to ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to withdraw two recently proposed rules aimed at revamping how stocks trade.
The move represents a coordinated industry push back against what are potentially the most impactful proposals in the SEC's biggest attempt to reform stock market rules in nearly 20 years.
""We are deeply concerned that the Commission has simultaneously issued multiple far-reaching proposals that would dramatically overhaul current market structure without adequately assessing the cumulative impact on the market or the potential for unintended consequences,"" the companies said in an SEC comment letter.
The SEC in December proposed requiring nearly all retail stock orders to be sent to auctions, as well as a new standard for brokers to show they get the best possible executions for their clients' orders. The SEC also proposed lower trading increments and access fees on exchanges, and more robust retail order execution disclosures.

The aim of the proposed rules is to improve market quality and efficiency, by boosting competition for retail stock orders and reducing unnecessary intermediation, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said.
The NYSE, along with Schwab and Citadel Securities, asked the SEC to indefinitely withdraw the auction and best execution proposals, saying they could lead to less market liquidity and create confusing regulatory overlap.
""We believe that this more targeted approach will result in significant benefits for U.S. equity market participants, while meaningfully reducing the risk of negative outcomes for markets and investors, including the risk of firms retreating from being liquidity providers - which would be particularly detrimental to retail investors,"" they said.
The SEC will review all comments submitted during the open comment period, and generally responds to comments received as part of the final rule-making and not beforehand, a spokesperson for the agency said.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"Chinese consumers out of COVID gates with caution, rather than zest",Casey Hall,2023-03-14 09:45:00+00:00,,"SHANGHAI, March 14 (Reuters) - Chinese consumers, unshackled from COVID-19 restrictions, are returning to hotels, restaurants and some shops, but they are choosy about what they buy, disappointing hopes for an immediate post-pandemic splurge.
China's battered property market, lingering worries over job stability, and government parsimony in wages, pensions and medical benefits are keeping shoppers cautious.
Analysts say their prudence adds pressure on policymakers, who have flagged boosting domestic demand as a top priority, to further stimulate the economy. But direct consumer subsidies are unlikely, sources told Reuters last month.
In the absence of additional support, the recovery in household consumption, long seen as key to improving sustainability of growth in the world's second-largest economy, is likely to be gradual and uneven, they say.
After China dropped most pandemic controls late in 2022, the share prices of many consumer-facing companies rose, reflecting optimism that a spending splurge was imminent.
""We have been warning that markets may become overly bullish about 'revenge' spending and the release of pent-up demand,"" said Nomura chief China economist Ting Lu, referring to the V-shaped spending recovery seen in the U.S. and other countries after COVID restrictions were lifted.
View 2 more stories 
""Markets should curb their enthusiasm due to the limited possibility of a large stimulus package, the elevated unemployment rate, a lack of confidence in the property sector, a slump in exports and geopolitical tensions.""
Prices of new Chinese homes fell for 16 months before steadying in January.
A survey of white-collar workers published last month by recruiting firm Zhaopin showed 47.3% of respondents were worried they might lose their jobs this year. Meanwhile, cash-strapped local governments have cut wages for civil servants, and older citizens are struggling with pensions that barely cover their costs of living.
Some economists, pointing to new household savings reaching 17.8 trillion yuan ($2.59 trillion) last year, an increase of 7.9 trillion yuan from 2021, had expected pent-up demand to drive a recovery in consumption even without policy support.
But there is little sign that enough money is being spent on goods and services to make much difference to consumption.
Data last week showed consumer inflation had slowed in February to its lowest annual rate in a year, while passenger car sales for the first two months of the year were down 20% on a year earlier. Imports have fallen faster than expected.
A data report on Wednesday is expected to show January-February retail sales were only 3.4% higher than a year before, when annual growth was 6.7%, according to a Reuters poll.
Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey, said most shoppers were still in wait-and-see mode, and the next holiday season, in May, would offer the next clues on whether their mood was changing.
""People are free to travel and spend, but they're not fully there yet compared to about 18 months ago, when they were incredibly confident about their future prospects,"" said Zipser.
Consumer confidence ticked up in January from 2022's record low, but was well below the levels seen in the past two decades.
Free tables in restaurants and coffee shops in Beijing or Shanghai are hard to find at peak hours, and many hotels and travel agencies have gone on a hiring spree as domestic tourism has returned.
The China Tourism Academy, an industry body, says domestic tourism revenue in 2023 could reach about 4 trillion yuan, about 95% more than last year but still only about 71% of the 2019 level.
Also, earnings updates suggest the business sector has subdued near-term expectations.
Yum China (9987.HK), which runs KFC and Pizza Hut in China, said last month it would offer promotions to get customers through the door. Starbucks (SBUX.O) warned of a ""cautious"" recovery in its China sales. Alibaba (9988.HK) said it saw demand for healthcare and wellness products improving, but sales for apparel and discretionary goods looked weak so far.
E-commerce giant JD.com (9618.HK) said consumer confidence would take time to rebuild.
""Consumers have become more meticulous in their spending,"" its chief executive, Xu Lei, said in an earnings call on Thursday.
Other businesses are noticing it as well.
One mid-range guesthouse owner in Dali, in Yunnan province, told Reuters that China's reopening had brought tourists back to the lake-side town, but not everyone was benefitting equally.
""Now the Chinese tourists are either super rich or very poor,"" said the owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""They are choosing either top-end or budget hotels.""
Julian Evans-Pritchard, an analyst at Capital Economics, attributes people's reluctance to open their wallets to household wealth declining for the first time in at least two decades last year due to falling prices for shares and homes.
""This suggests that once the initial reopening rebound has happened, we shouldn't expect a further surge in consumer spending,"" he wrote in a note to clients.

Basic pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 6.5% compared with 6.7% in the three months to December, representing the first slowdown in the that measure since late 2021.
Total pay grew by an annual 5.7% in the November-to-January period, slowing from 6.0% in the previous figures and the weakest increase since the three months to July last year, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected basic and total earnings to rise by 6.6% and 5.7% respectively.
Britain's unemployment rate held at 3.7% in the three months to January, close to its lowest in almost five decades, the data also showed.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected the rate to rise to 3.8%.

Interest rate futures showed investors were putting the chance of the BoE pausing its rate hikes next week at about 40% at 0830 GMT while a quarter of a percentage point increase in borrowing costs was seen as a 60% possibility.
Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said while the ONS data showed a slowing of pay growth, more recent measures showed little change recently.
""Coupled with stronger-than-expected GDP data, this should provide enough evidence for the Bank to raise rates when it meets next week,"" Selfin said.
But Martin Beck, with forecasters the EY ITEM Club, said a BoE rates pause was now likely after 10 back-to-back hikes.
""These moves follow other developments, including an unexpectedly significant decline in the services sector inflation in January,"" Beck said.
Sterling rose against the dollar and the euro shortly after the data before falling back.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce measures in his budget statement on Wednesday that will seek to get more people into work, easing the inflationary pressure in the labour market.
""The jobs market remains strong, but inflation remains too high,"" finance minister Jeremy Hunt said after the data was published, a day ahead of his budget speech.
""Tomorrow at the budget, I will set out how we will go further to bear down on inflation, reduce debt and grow the economy, including by helping more people back into work.""
Tuesday's data showed earnings were further diminished by an inflation rate that stood above 10% in January.
The ONS said basic pay, when adjusted for inflation using the consumer prices index, fell by 3.5%, one of the largest falls since records began in 2001. Total pay fell by 4.4% in real terms, the biggest drop since early 2009.
There were some signs of a further easing of the tightness in the labour market with the economic inactivity rate - measuring people out of work and not looking for it - falling by 0.2 percentage points to 21.3%, driven mostly by young people.
Vacancies decreased for the eighth time in a row in the three months to February, falling by 51,000 from the previous three months to 1.124 million.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"Instant View: India's February retail inflation marginally eases, remains above central bank target",Reuters,2023-03-13 13:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BENOIFUOZ5L6NOIBRUZC3DMI4E.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - India's annual retail inflation rate (INCPIY=ECI) eased to 6.44% in February, helped by a fall in the price of some food items, but remained above central bank targets, reinforcing expectations for a further interest rate hike at its meeting next month.
The February reading was higher than the 6.35% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and was above the upper band of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 2%-6% target, data released by the National Statistics Office on Monday showed.
Annual retail inflation was 6.52% in January.
Food prices, which account for nearly 40% of the CPI basket, rose 5.95% in February, compared with 6.0% in January, as edible oil and vegetable prices eased.
COMMENTARY:
""While the headline February 2023 CPI inflation has come in slightly below our expectations, it nevertheless remains fairly elevated close to January level – that had sprung a sizeable upward surprise.
View 2 more stories 
""Fortunately, the sequential momentum in food prices registered a marginal deceleration, though granular pulls and pressures were evident. Protein-rich items like eggs, meat, fish and pulses offered respite along with oils and fats and vegetables, besides a lower momentum in cereals - a likely outcome of open market sales of wheat concentrated in February.
""(However) discomfort on food price outlook remains amidst soaring temperatures and the possibility of El Nino later in the year.
""We continue to expect the RBI to hike the repo rate by another 25 bps in April while keeping its stance unchanged. However, the central bank is also likely to keep a close eye on potential stress in the US banking system and stand ready to be nimble and proactive, if the need arises.""
""While relatively unchanged food inflation helped, worry about core inflation persists. At 6.6% YoY, it is at an eight-and-a-half-year high and suggesting no respite in sight. Goods inflation continues to bite and remains way above the core inflation, as does the continued increase in real estate prices. We, therefore, retain our view of another additional rate hike by the RBI in the April meeting.
""However, if the effect of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and fear of meltdown in the financial market caused by additional tightening gets the U.S. Federal Reserve to think differently, pressure of a rate hike by the RBI might diminish.""
""The high inflation print again reflects the soaring cereal inflation which has been a matter of concern for the economy even though the latest set of inflation data may again overstate the extent of the increase. That said, the world order has again evolved dramatically, with higher global (and Indian) inflation prints getting collided with new uncertainties regarding the US banking system.
""Clearly the markets are flitting from theme to theme, unveiling underlying fragility. We are closely watching consistent global policy rates repricing, the pace of global inflation and banking system evolution, and the case for impending recession – all of which will shape the central bank's policies, which could have implications for India.
""Back home, the inflation outlook is fraught with uncertainty. April will likely see another 25 bps hike and the RBI would continue to be non-committal on future rates path, as the fluid global situation demands frequent macro re-assessments.""
""Second consecutive month of more than 6% inflation makes the monetary authority's job difficult. The impact of monetary policy is felt with a lag and monetary tightening of FY23 would push the inflation rate down. However, the stickiness of core inflation is turning out to be a major problem for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Core inflation in February 2023 has remained in excess of 6% for the last four months.
While the delayed impact of monetary policy and the government's steps in cooling wheat inflation may tempt the MPC to go for status quo on policy rate.
""The slight drop in headline CPI inflation in February wouldn't have been enough to ease the concerns of the hawks on the MPC and, as a result, we now expect another 25 bps hike to the repo rate (to 6.75%) at the RBI's next policy meeting in April. But we doubt the hiking cycle will extend beyond that.""
""February CPI inflation while elevated is broadly in line with expectations. Cereals and milk inflation continue to be high, while fruit prices spiked up too in February. However, we see food inflation softening in March based on recent price trends.
""Core inflation remains elevated and sticky with relatively high inflation across clothing and footwear, health, personal care and effects, and household goods/services. The RBI will remain hawkish in the April policy as inflation prints have spiked back over 6% in January-February along with core inflation remaining sticky above 6%.
""We continue to expect a 25 bps repo rate hike in the April policy.""
""February CPI came nearly in line with our estimates and was led mainly by higher-than-expected print on housing and sticky core inflation. Core inflation has remained above 6% for four consecutive months underlying still-prevailing pricing power in the services sector.
""The recent developments in the United States amid the failure of the SVB and actions taken by the central bank thereafter have toned down expectations of an aggressive action despite elevated U.S. inflation.
""In this backdrop, we expect the MPC to hike repo rate by 25 bps in April policy and remain data-dependent thereafter.""
""CPI inflation at 6.44% in February is partly due to the statistical adjustment made for the food grains distributed through PDS. I think the MPC will take this into account before finalising the quantum of a rate hike in April. The quarterly GDP data was not encouraging for private consumption and investment spending.
""Moreover, global risks are rising because of the contagion effect of the SVB failure. As of today, I expect the MPC to recommend a hike of 25 bps in the April policy and give clear forward guidance on future actions.
""While the correction in the prices of heavily weighted items in the CPI basket such as wheat, vegetables and edible oils augurs well for the food inflation print in the current month amidst a high base, there are concerns around the impact of a likely heat wave on the wheat crop and the consequent impact on wheat prices in the near term. This, along with the possibility of the occurrence of El Nino around the summer season and its impact on monsoons, would play an important role in determining the trajectory of food inflation over the next few quarters.
""Given two consecutive CPI inflation prints above 6%, the MPC may go in for another rate hike, although the decision is likely to be non-unanimous based on the minutes of the last review. Moreover, global developments over the next three weeks could impact the MPC's decision.
""The February CPI print came broadly in line with our expectations but higher than the MPC's upper threshold levels of 6% for two consecutive months.
""While the global financial instability has reduced the probability of a 50 basis points (bps) hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Indian rupee has remained largely well behaved, we expect the higher-than-6% inflation to keep the MPC cautious and hike the repo rate by 25 bps in the upcoming April policy.""
""Inflation came in higher than expected, led by higher food inflation — particularly cereals and milk inflation. The risk to inflation is tilted towards the upside with El-Nino conditions predicted in 2023. The still sticky core provides little leg room for absorbing any spikes in food inflation that might develop in the coming months.
""Rabi sowing has also been tepid compared to last year. Overall inflation prints could edge below 6% over the next quarter on account of base effects, but they are likely to jump back above 6% in the July-September quarter if the above risks materialise.

WPI (INWPI=ECI) in February eased to 3.85% year-on-year, compared with 4.73% in the previous month.
It was below the Reuters forecast of 4%, and also marked the lowest since January 2021, when it recorded 2.51%.
In February food index rose 2.76% year-on-year, from 2.95% in January, while fuel and power rose 14.82% from 15.15%.
Decline in the rate of inflation was broad based primarily driven by fall in prices of crude, energy prices, non-food and food articles, the government said in the statement.
Data released on Monday showed India's annual retail inflation eased to 6.44% in February, helped by a fall in the price of some food items.

India's headline and core inflation has been unrelenting, with data post market close on Monday showing annual retail inflation remained above the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) upper limit, easing only slightly from January's 6.52%.
""We expect the focus to remain on reducing inflation, both globally and in India,"" Gaura Sen Gupta, economist with IDFC First Bank, said on Tuesday.
""Policymakers are likely to use other tools to ringfence financial institutions and use rate hikes to tame inflation.""
Globally, investors scrambled to pull down rate expectations on Monday and abandoned bets on the Federal Reserve pushing through bigger hikes, reckoning the biggest American bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis will make policymakers think twice.

""We continue to expect the RBI to hike policy rates by 25 bps in April. The January and February prints will only increase the (RBI's) concerns on core inflation showing persistence,"" said Sen Gupta.
Economists said the February inflation print has significantly raised the probability of the central bank's 5.7% inflation projection for the quarter ended March 2023 being missed.
""Overall, the worst period of high inflation is likely behind us. We expect March inflation to come around 6% and to retreat toward 5% in the coming months,"" Motilal Oswal analysts wrote in a note, saying the 25-bps hike in April was a ""given"".

It was highest monthly deficit since 1984, the first year for which such data is available, according to central bank records. Before that time Turkey did not have an economy large enough to generate such a deficit, data shows.
Flipping Turkey's chronic current account deficit, at $48.7 billion in 2022, into a surplus has been one of the main goals under President Tayyip Erdogan's economic programme that also prioritises growth, exports and employment with low rates.
In a Reuters poll, the median estimate for the current account deficit in January was $10 billion, with forecasts ranging from $6 billion to $11.1 billion.
Turkey's trade deficit, a major component of the current account, widened 38% in January to $14.24 billion, data showed, mainly due to the sharp rise in gold imports and the surging cost of energy imports.

Excluding gold and energy, the current account showed a surplus of $2.6 billion in January, compared with a surplus of $1.7 billion in the same month last year.
Economists expect the current account balance to record further deficits in the coming months and expect the deficit to stand at $43.5 billion at the end of the year, the poll showed.
Economists are also monitoring the impact of the massive earthquakes that hit the country's southeast in February as well as the course of energy and gold imports after authorities introduced measures to limit gold imports last month.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,"China consumer inflation slowest in a year, leaves room for more stimulus",Liangping Gao,2023-03-09 05:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/A4HBFVUGJRKETGWDCY5ZXUQSTY.jpg,"BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - China's annual consumer inflation slowed to the lowest rate in a year in February as consumers remained cautious despite the abandonment of strong pandemic controls late in 2022.
Combined with persistence of producer deflation, also reported on Thursday, the data showed price pressure had become no obstacle to more government action to support economic recovery from COVID-19 disruption, analysts said.
The consumer price index (CPI) in February was 1.0% higher than a year earlier, rising at the slowest pace since February 2022, said the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The result was well below the median estimate of 1.9% in a Reuters poll and the 2.1% annual rise seen in January.
The government is targeting an average level of consumer prices this year about 3% higher than in 2022.
""For monetary policy, which is focused on consolidating the economic recovery and achieving stable upward momentum, there is no constraint from an inflation rate that is within the policy target,"" said Bruce Pang, chief economist for greater China at JLL, commenting on the data.

Zhiwei Zhang, president of Pinpoint Asset Management, said the figures conflicted with other data that showed considerable strength in domestic demand.
""Nonetheless, the weak CPI inflation opens room for the government to launch more monetary easing policies,"" he said.
Economists generally do not expect big monetary policy moves this year, however. The government cut bank reserve requirements twice last year to stimulate the economy.
Whereas other countries are suffering decades-high inflation rates, strenuous efforts at controlling COVID-19 in China last year disrupted production and suppressed demand, keeping price pressure contained. Economists expect inflation to strengthen in coming months, mostly thanks to the end of pandemic controls.
The yuan weakened on Thursday as the price data revived investors' doubts about the pace of the recovery, which is facing the challenge of weakening foreign demand and a domestic property downturn.
The parliament has set what analysts say is a conservative growth target for 2023 gross domestic product of around 5%, a sign that policymakers are conscious of economic headwinds.
The NBS attributed the slowing growth in consumer prices to falling demand after the January's Lunar New Year holidays. Most fresh food prices had fallen as a result of warm weather and abundant supply, it said.
The CPI, which is seasonally adjusted, fell 0.5% from a month earlier, missing the forecast of 0.2% gain. The monthly CPI rise in January was 0.8%.
Core annual consumer inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 0.6% in February, compared with January's 1.0%.
Producer deflation deepened and extended into a fifth month.
The producer price index (PPI) in February was down 1.4% on a year earlier, largely driven by softer commodity costs. That compared with the median expectation for a 1.3% decline in a Reuters poll and an annual contraction of 0.8% seen in January.
Since October, producer prices have consistently been lower than a year earlier.
The economy gave one of its weakest performances in decades last year, squeezed by three years of pandemic controls, the property downturn and a crackdown on private enterprise.
To bolster growth, the government plans to stick with its usual playbook of spending on infrastructure.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Analysis: Some U.S. banks facing stock rout may need to seek partners,Nupur Anand,2023-03-14 10:55:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK, March 14 (Reuters) - Some U.S. regional banks are under pressure after the collapse of two lenders within days, with industry executives and advisers saying they could be forced to seek saviors if a rout in their stocks doesn't let up.
U.S. regulators announced extraordinary measures on Sunday following the collapse of SVB Financial Group (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O), offering a safety net to banks pressured by fleeing depositors. On Monday, President Joe Biden vowed to take action to ensure the safety of the banking system.
But the intervention did little to prop up the banks' shares, which slumped on Monday, posing a major impediment to growing their businesses and getting funding.
""If this continues to escalate you will have a liquidity drain from the mid to small banks,"" said David Ellison, a portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds, which had a position in Signature Bank.
Raising private capital could help inspire confidence again in their stocks. Possible outcomes for under-pressure regional banks could see a stronger rival take over a weaker, or cash infusions from investors such as private equity, the industry sources said.

Over the weekend, some private equity firms had studied the possibility of an investment in banks whose shares plummeted such as First Republic Bank (FRC.N) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW.O), according to two industry sources with knowledge of the matter. They did not go ahead as the investors wanted to see what the government would do to alleviate pressure on the banking sector, the sources said.
With the emergency measures in place, those possibilities could be revived in the coming days.
First Republic declined comment. PacWest did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours.
One banking source said investors looking at banks that saw sharp declines in their share prices may want to wait a few days before they consider deals or cash infusions.
At that point, bank targets may be persuaded to do deals not because they need the liquidity, but to show they have the backings of large institutional investors.
There could be other ways for banks to try to shore up confidence, too. First Republic, for example, secured additional financing from JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, although that did not keep its stock from falling on Monday.
Investors voted with their feet on Monday, putting bank stocks under pressure around the world. The KBW regional banking index (.KRX) fell 5.4% and the S&P 500 banking index (.SPXBK) dropped 6% in a chaotic day when several banks saw multiple trading halts because of the size of the moves.
Weighing on sentiment was the federal government's statement that shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders would not be protected -- something that might give investors in the banks pause.
""This is not a bailout. So investors think it’s a relative gamble staying around owning regional banks before knowing what will change in regulation,"" said Brian Levitt, global market strategist for Invesco.
There are also other hurdles to deals. The Biden administration has taken a tough stance on deals over antitrust concerns and it is not clear whether they would be receptive to rescue transactions now.
Still, investors may find deals in the battered sector. Regional bank stocks are ""an incredible bargain now,"" billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on Twitter on Monday.
""There’s value in these banks, they are not all alike,"" said Michael Farr, chief executive of investment advisory firm Farr, Miller & Washington who owns banks stocks including PNC and Truist. ""You do your homework and see where real value exists.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Analysis: Investors revive inflation trades as 6% Fed rate risk grips Wall Street,Davide Barbuscia,2023-03-07 15:30:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BXHMFRMYHJOSXN4Z2XYCZVYMSU.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Spooked by a flurry of hotter-than-expected U.S. economic and inflation data last month, investors are reviving trading strategies that bet on a higher peak in interest rates.
The recalibration in inflation expectations has led some investors to bet on a policy rate of 6% or even higher. Risk assets like stocks and corporate bonds that benefited from a months-long disinflationary narrative until the end of January have lost momentum, with traders now seeking shelter in safer assets like Treasuries or cash.
""The last month was a bit of a wake-up call,"" said Doug Fincher, a portfolio manager at Ionic Capital Management and a co-portfolio manager of an inflation protection exchange traded fund. ""People still under appreciate it, but we're definitely seeing renewed interest in inflation-type products,"" he said.
Bets on the Federal Reserve more aggressively hiking rates have gained more traction in money markets. The probability that the Fed may increase rates to as high as 6% in September, which is when Fed funds futures traders see rates peaking, stood at over 13% on Monday, up from about 8% a week earlier, CME Group data showed.

Alfonso Peccatiello, chief executive of The Macro Compass, a global macro investment strategy firm, said anecdotal evidence from clients in the hedge fund industry showed ""large interest"" in trading structures that bet on the Fed's policy rate hitting 6% or higher by December, and on interest rates still above 5% by June next year.
These trades are often implemented via options, in particular by betting on the direction of the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) - with a 'yes or no' wager on a level above 6% the main factor driving the trade's profitability, Peccatiello said.
Trading platform Tradeweb said it saw average daily volume in inflation swaps - derivatives used to hedge inflation risk - increase by 23% month-on-month in February.
With higher inflation expectations lifting short-term bond yields higher than those at the longer end, some investors are wary of committing to debt maturities at the long end of the bond market yield curve.
Anthony Woodside, head of U.S. fixed income strategy at LGIM America, said underweighting corporate credit in favor of risk-free assets such as Treasuries was one way to play the higher-for-longer theme over the next few months.
""While all-in yields look attractive, corporate credit spreads look too tight given that we are likely headed for a downturn amidst restrictive monetary policy,"" he said, referring to expectations the tightening could eventually trigger a sharp economic slowdown.
Outside of fixed income, adding exposure to commodities could be a way to take advantage of the demand behind the current impulse in global economies.
""With China being a large source of demand we see potential for upward pressure on oil prices in the coming quarters. Copper can benefit for similar reasons,"" Woodside said.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday told U.S. lawmakers the central bank will likely need to raise interest rates more than expected in response to recent strong data, potentially even moving in larger steps.
Traders had largely expected the central bank to raise rates by 25 basis points at its next rate-setting meeting on March 21-22, but after Powell's remarks on Tuesday Fed funds futures were pricing in a 50 basis points hike, CME Group data showed.
The U.S. Federal Reserve last year lifted borrowing costs at the fastest pace in 40 years, but scaled back to a quarter-percentage-point rate increase last month.
In the market, pricing has moved in expectation of more aggressive rate hikes as the latest economic data reflects a tight job market and inflation remaining high, reviving fears the Fed may need to resort once again to the same chunky interest rate hikes that hammered stocks and bonds last year.
A proxy of inflation expectations such as the breakeven rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) has gone from 2.12% in January - the lowest in nearly two years - to about 2.5%, its highest since November.
U.S. government bond yields spiked in February with the benchmark 10-year yield back at over 4% last week, its highest since November. Two-year yields , which more closely reflect monetary policy expectations, have gained about 70 basis points since the beginning of last month, reaching levels not seen since 2007 before the financial crisis.
""The Fed could be forced to go 50 basis points at their next Federal Open Market Committee meeting if we get another strong employment report,"" said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, who sees a terminal rate possibly above 6%.
""The momentum in the economy is so strong that we may have to get into 2024 before the Fed funds rate peaks.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Analysis: US bank regulators may take wait-and-see approach before intervening again,Pete Schroeder,2023-03-14 05:08:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/CPTCATPQ6ZNH5M7MZ2BEVBJOVA.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are likely to let emergency measures announced Sunday to shore up investor confidence in the banking sector sink in and increase scrutiny of the industry before intervening with any further steps, regulatory experts said.
Fears remained on Wall Street on Monday despite the measures announced over the weekend following the collapse of California-based Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) and New York-based Signature Bank (SBNY.O). Regional bank shares tumbled, and the S&P 500 Banking Index ended the day down 7%, its largest one-day fall since June 11, 2020.
Some investors have called for further action by banking regulators to reassure markets. But banking experts said regulators would likely want to see the extent of any further contagion before deciding on fresh measures.
""It all depends on what the situation will look like,"" said Saule Omarova, a law professor at Cornell Law School who President Joe Biden once nominated to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a top banking regulator. ""Whatever else they can do will depend on how creative they are.""

Some experts also argued there were some signs for optimism that the intervention was helping.
""It's noteworthy that we haven’t seen any bank failures yet throughout the day,"" said Young Kim, a banking lawyer with Clifford Change. “At least some of their objectives were achieved as it concerns calming fears.”
Regulators, however, are likely to turn their attention to gaps in supervision that allowed these banks to build up unsustainable risk, these experts said.
Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr was already conducting a review of bank capital rules before the turmoil. In addition, the Fed announced Monday it was doing an internal review of its oversight of Silicon Valley Bank, where it was the primary regulator.
Prior to Silicon Valley Bank's collapse, banks had been lobbying lawmakers to push back against the Fed's review, arguing it could slow the economy.
But one lobbyist who asked not to be named said on Monday the events of the last few days ""gives Michael Barr unfettered ability to turn all the dials in any direction he wants.""
A Fed spokesman declined to comment.
Several experts said the tools already announced, including a deposit guarantee at the two failed banks and a new Federal Reserve facility that can provide banks with liquidity on attractive terms, should address market concerns for now.
Silicon Valley Bank failed days after announcing it had to raise capital to offset losses brought on by rapid interest rate increases, and its extremely high level of uninsured deposits were quick to flee.
The experts said the measures announced Sunday are squarely aimed at both issues, giving banks easy access to emergency funds and sending a message that bank deposits, even uninsured ones, are safe.
Some dramatic steps, such as raising the $250,000 ceiling for FDIC deposit insurance, would require new laws from Congress, an uncertain prospect in a divided government where policymakers are already feuding over next steps.
""The Fed and Treasury have kind of shot their bazooka for now,"" said Mark Sobel, a former senior U.S. Treasury official who is U.S. chairman of the London-based OMFIF financial think tank. ""I think it's a question of the market steadying out.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,US expected to report strong consumer price increases in February,Lucia Mutikani,2023-03-14 04:05:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices likely rose at a solid pace in February amid sticky rental housing costs, but economists are divided on whether the data will be enough to push the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates again next week after the failure of two regional banks.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday, which is also expected to show goods inflation picked up in part due to an anticipated rebound in prices of used motor vehicles, will be published amid financial market turmoil triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in California and Signature Bank in New York, which forced regulators to take emergency measures to shore up confidence in the banking system.
It will also be released a week before the Fed begins a two-day policy meeting, and follow on the heels of a report last Friday showing a still-tight labor market, but cooling wage inflation. Economists said Tuesday's report remained important for policymakers despite the angst in financial markets.
""If the Fed meeting was today, then you'd have to say the Fed is not going to do anything,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""If the actions from the Fed, Treasury and the FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) help to calm markets, then you'd have to say that a 25-basis-point hike is still the most likely outcome.""

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) likely increased by 0.4% last month after accelerating 0.5% in January, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would lower the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 6.0% in February, which would mark the smallest year-on-year rise since September 2021. The CPI rose at a 6.4% pace in the 12 months through January.
The annual CPI peaked at 9.1% in June, which was the biggest increase since November 1981. Monthly inflation is rising at double the rate that economists say is needed to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last week that the U.S. central bank would likely need to raise rates more than expected, leading financial markets to expect that a half-percentage-point rate increase was on the table next week.
But those expectations were dialed back to 25 basis points after the employment report.
While financial markets on Monday still expected a quarter-percentage-point hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool, fear of contagion from the banking crisis prompted some economists, including those at Goldman Sachs, to expect the Fed next week to pause its fastest monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s.
""It should be noted that these problems (at smaller banks) were largely set up by over-easy Fed policy for many years and are now being triggered by excessive tightening,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York. ""In light of this reality, it is possible that the Fed will now halt its tightening cycle.""
The Fed has increased its benchmark overnight interest rate by 450 basis points since last March from the near-zero level to the current 4.50%-4.75% range.
Consumer inflation last month was largely pushed by stubbornly high rents. Food prices are expected to have risen moderately after climbing 0.5% in January. Gasoline prices likely increased, but overall energy prices probably eased slightly because of a decrease in the cost of energy services.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI is forecast to have increased 0.4% for a third straight month. Another solid rise in owners' equivalent rent (OER), a measure of the amount homeowners would pay to rent or would earn from renting their property, is expected to have been the main driver of the increase in the so-called core CPI. OER advanced 0.7% in January.
Independent measures, however, suggest rental inflation is cooling, leading many economists to believe that price pressures could decelerate considerably in the second half of the year. The rent measures in the CPI tend to lag the independent gauges.
Increases are also expected in the cost of hotel and motel rooms. With rents remaining hot, services less energy, probably recorded another month of strong price gains after rising 0.5% in January. Fed officials are closely watching the prices of services outside housing and energy, to gauge their progress in taming inflation. According to economists' calculations, core services prices excluding housing rose 0.4% in February.
Upward pressure on core inflation is also expected to come from goods, with prices of used cars and trucks expected to have rebounded in February after declining for seven straight months. Core goods prices are forecast to have risen further after increasing in January for the first time since August.
In the 12 months through February, the core CPI is forecast to have gained 5.5%. That would be the smallest increase since December 2021 and would follow a 5.6% advance in January.
Given that inflation is far from subsiding and the labor market is still tight, some economists expect the Fed to press ahead with its rate hiking campaign.
""Doing so (pausing) would invite markets and the public to assume that the Fed's inflation-fighting resolve is only in place up to the point when there is any bumpiness in financial markets or the real economy,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup in New York.

The Federal Reserve also set up a new facility to give banks access to emergency funds.
U.S. stocks were mixed, and bond markets repriced rate expectations on the thinking that the Fed can only be reluctant to hike next week while the mood is febrile and delicate.
U.S. interest rate futures surged and a hard-running rally in short-term bonds extended, putting two-year Treasuries on course for their best three-day gain since Black Monday in 1987.
Bank stress and the resultant shakeout of loan books mean higher borrowing costs, said Akira Takei, fixed income portfolio manager at Asset Management One in Tokyo, with the resulting pressure in the real economy making further hikes difficult.

A late-Sunday note from Goldman Sachs, in which the bank's analysts said the banking stress meant they no longer forecast the Fed to hike rates next week, gave the rates rally an extra leg in the Asia session.
U.S. two-year yields briefly fell below 4% for the first time since last October and were last down 54.7 basis points (bps) at 4.04%. The two-year note's yield was on track for the biggest one-day drop since October 1987 in the wake of that fateful ""Black Monday"" stock market crash.
At 4.04%, the two-year yield is also below the bottom end of the Fed funds rate window at 4.5% - a sign markets see rates' peak is near. The latest futures pricing implies a 44% chance the Fed stands pat next week and a 57% probability of a 25 bp hike - a huge shift from last week when markets braced for a 50 bp hike.
""I think people are linking Silicon Valley Bank's problems with the rate hikes we've already had,"" said ING economist Rob Carnell.
""If rates going up caused this, the Fed is going to be mindful of that in future,"" he said. ""It's not going to want to go clattering in with another 50 (bp hike) and see some other financial institution getting hosed.""
Monday's early moves also sharply pulled forward and pushed down market expectations for where rates peak. From about 5.7% on Wednesday, implied pricing for the peak in U.S. rates fell to 4.7% on Monday and year-end expectations - above 5.5% last week - tumbled to about 3.9%, a drop of about 160 bps in days.
There were also rallies in Australian interest-rate futures and European futures , which rarely move much in Asia, with traders reckoning global policymakers turn cautious.
The size of the shifts drew warnings from analysts who said they could unwind quickly, especially if U.S. inflation data is hot next week. Long-dated bonds were also left behind, with inflation being a greater risk if hikes were to slow or stop.
""The market, particularly in the Asia time zone is still digesting the news about the fall of the SVB,"" said Jack Chambers, senior rates strategist at ANZ Bank in Sydney.
""If anything, support for deposit holders supports the idea that the Fed could keep tightening policy,"" he said, if the measures were able to ring-fence problems to a few banks.
Still, a new Fed bank funding program aimed at addressing some of Silicon Valley Bank's apparent problems with losses in its bond portfolio is expected to further help with stability for banks and bonds.
Banks will now be able to borrow at the Fed against collateral such as Treasuries at par, rather than market value - greatly reducing any need for banks to liquidate bonds to meet unexpected withdrawals.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Euro zone ministers back tighter fiscal stance for 2024,Reuters,2023-03-13 18:16:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/53DLKSEAIBNIZFSAVBA6AEAQHI.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 13 (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers on Monday backed a European Commission recommendation to start tightening fiscal policy, gradually phasing out government support against high energy prices to business and households.
The European Commission called last week on EU governments to gradually start tightening fiscal policy since an expected technical recession did not materialise, the labour market was very tight and borrowing costs were rising fast as the European Central Bank was working to bring down high inflation.
""While uncertainty surrounding the outlook, notably in relation to geopolitical and energy related factors, remains elevated, risks to growth appear more balanced than previously,"" the ministers said in a statement.
""We agree that over 2023-24, prudent fiscal policies should aim at ensuring medium-term debt sustainability, while raising potential growth in a sustainable manner and addressing the green and digital transitions and resilience objectives through investment and reforms,"" they said.

""In light of economic prospects and in a context of high inflation and tighter financing conditions, we reiterate that broad-based fiscal stimulus to aggregate demand is not warranted,"" they said.
The ministers repeated their pledge to better coordinate policies supporting the economy against high energy prices so as not to put poorer countries, which cannot afford as much energy subsidies as the richer ones, at a competitive disadvantage.
""Absent renewed price shocks, we will continue to phase out energy support measures, which would also contribute to reducing government deficits,"" the ministers said in their statement.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,NY Fed report shows near-term inflation expectations retreating sharply,Michael S. Derby,2023-03-13 17:05:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/42ZB3QFAQBJBFBSZRYITTYSEHA.jpg,"NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Americans' expectations for the near-term path of inflation ebbed to nearly a two-year low last month, which could take pressure off the Federal Reserve to raise rates amid fresh uncertainties created by turmoil in the U.S. banking system.
In the first of a run of key readings on inflation, consumer spending and sentiment that could determine whether the U.S. central bank presses on with interest rate hikes or pauses to measure the fallout from bank failures that prompted it to take emergency action, the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations on Monday showed respondents said inflation would stand at 4.2% a year from now.
That's a notable drop from the 5% expectation in January and the lowest reading since the 4% registered in May 2021.
Meanwhile, the expected level of inflation three years from now held steady at 2.7%, matching the level last seen in October 2020, while expected inflation five years from now was seen hitting 2.6%, up from January's 2.5%.
The Labor Department will release Consumer Price Index data for February on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect CPI will slow to a 0.4% gain on a month-to-month basis and to a 6% gain on an annual basis. Excluding food and energy prices, CPI is also forecast to cool to a 0.4% rise on a monthly basis, with the annualized rate ticking down to a 5.5% gain.

The New York Fed survey arrived just ahead of the Fed's March 21-22 policy meeting. Until this past weekend, the gathering had widely been expected to result in an interest rate increase, as the central bank presses forward with its effort to cool high levels of inflation.
But the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, which forced government authorities to offer new liquidity support to the banking system, has scrambled the monetary policy outlook. Some analysts, including those from Goldman Sachs, are now arguing against a rate increase, while others believe the economic outlook still calls for more action to help bring price pressures back to the Fed's 2% target.
In recent days, Fed officials had noted that what appeared to be a softening trend in price pressures was essentially a mirage. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, in testimony to Congress last week, made the case that the central bank likely would need to be more aggressive with its rate rises over time to bring inflation back down.
A higher-than-expected CPI reading - the data are due to be released at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) on Tuesday - could renew pressure on the Fed to boost rates again even as financial stability concerns, which are critical to monetary policy deliberations, might argue for the central bank to stay its hand.
The New York Fed report was conducted ahead of the SVB situation and does not reflect its impact.
On its own, the survey was a positive development for the Fed, as officials believe the public's expected path of inflation helps drive the actual level of price pressures. U.S. central bank officials have long flagged the relative stability of longer-run inflation expectations as a sign the public remains confident the Fed will bring price pressures back to the target.
The report found expectations of softer prices across a number of key components. Households last month saw declining price pressures for gasoline, food, rent, medical care and college. The public also held a more upbeat view on the job market as well as improved views regarding household finances.
The report said households foresee a 1.4% rise in housing prices, up from the 1.1% expectation in January. But the New York Fed noted that last month's reading remains well below the 12-month average of an expected 3.4% rise in home prices.

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,How high will you go? Five questions for the ECB,Dhara Ranasinghe,2023-03-13 16:58:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BJARDOD6DVNWPFOJ5FMEHDQWFU.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank looks set to deliver another interest rate hike on Thursday, but turmoil in global bank stocks makes the outlook suddenly uncertain.
A surprise surge in underlying inflation in February had left policymakers fretting that price pressures could prove persistent.
Now, confidence in a large 50 basis point (bps) hike has weakened as turmoil in the U.S. banking sector raises fears about contagion in Europe.
The ECB has already tightened monetary policy by 3 percentage points since July.
Here are five questions for markets.
1/ What will the ECB do?
ECB President Christine Lagarde said recently a 50 basis points (bps) rate hike ""is very, very likely"".
Yet traders cut their bets on such a move to around a 40% chance on Monday. It was almost fully priced in ahead of the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O).
View 2 more stories 
The ECB may be inclined to sound less hawkish in the face of renewed market turmoil, analysts said.
""I think the (ECB) communication on Thursday is still going to be for a 50 basis point rate hike, the underlying inflation problem is still there,"" said Danske Bank chief analyst Piet Christiansen.
""But I think there's going to be much more emphasis on the outlook from Lagarde on Thursday than if SVB hadn't happened.""
2/ What happens after March?
Markets have also dialled back expectations for May. Traders have now slashed bets on a 50 bps ECB hike in May they previously saw as highly likely, so signalling is key.
It could pre-commit to another big hike, stress a meeting-by-meeting approach, or flag several smaller increases.
Hawks have urged bigger moves. Austria's central bank chief Robert Holzmann wants half-point moves at each of the next four meetings. Chief economist Philip Lane says ""calibration"" of further increases depends on new forecasts and data.
The ECB is meanwhile expected to stick to plans for shrinking its balance sheet by 15 billion euros ($15.89 billion) a month through June.
The banking sector turbulence was seen strengthening the case for a meeting-by-meeting approach.
3/ Where will rates peak?
Just a week ago market pricing suggested rates could rise to 4% by the end of the year. U.S. rate rise expectations also shot up. But that has been rapidly dialled back following the SVB collapse and money markets now see ECB rates peaking below 3.5% this year.
Germany's two-year bond yield, which rose above 3% in late February for the first time since 2008, has also fallen back sharply. .
""They (central banks) have to tackle their core mandate of getting inflation under control, they need to protect their credibility and keep signalling tightening policy but they do need to acknowledge signs of strain in some parts of the financial system,"" said Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group.
4/ Does the ECB think inflation is stuck?
Inflation, stripping out volatile food, energy, alcohol and tobacco prices, touched a record 5.6% last month and some policymakers fear that the increase is the result of a surge in wages in the services sector, which makes price growth harder to break.
Lagarde believes underlying inflation will stay high near-term and could be pressed on that time horizon.
Analysts say the cumulative impact of rate hikes has yet to be felt and will help to lower inflation.
5/ What about latest ECB economic projections?
Signs of economic resilience suggest ECB growth forecasts, also out on Thursday, could be revised upwards for 2023. Euro area business activity growth was at a nine-month high in February.
Falling energy prices and a stronger euro, up around 6% in trade-weighted terms from August lows, suggest headline inflation forecasts could be revised lower.
Strong underlying price pressures mean longer-term forecasts will be watched closely.
""In their forecasts, headline inflation should be lower, as energy prices fall, but core inflation is staying very stubbornly high,"" Eoin Walsh, portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management, said, adding: ""They will certainly be careful not to sound too dovish.""

Macro Matters,/markets/macromatters/,Financial tremors now muddying Fed inflation debate,Howard Schneider,2023-03-13 15:04:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/42ZB3QFAQBJBFBSZRYITTYSEHA.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials meet next week again chasing persistent inflation but now balancing that against the first acute tremors from the aggressive interest rate hikes the central bank approved over the past year.
The sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank last week isn't expected to prevent the Fed from continuing to raise interest rates at its March 21-22 meeting, with inflation still running far above the Fed's 2% target and Fed chair Jerome Powell indicating monetary policy might need to become even more aggressive.
But it could add a dose of caution to the policy debate and undermine the sense, common among officials so far, that Fed policy had not caused anything to ""break"" in an economy where spending and job growth have seemed immune to the impact of higher interest rates.
SVB's failure, which the Fed came to a view as a potentially systemic shock if bank depositors faced losses, prompted the Fed to announce a new bank lending facility on Sunday in an effort to maintain confidence in the system - effectively putting the Fed back in the business of emergency lending even as it tries to tighten credit overall with higher interest rates.

Given the stakes that bit of dissonance seemed unavoidable, and may be accompanied by a slightly softer approach to monetary policy if risks are seen to be intensifying.
""The threat of a systemic disruption in the banking system is small, but the risk of stoking financial instability may well encourage the Fed to opt for a smaller rate increase at the upcoming meeting,"" Oxford Economics economist Bob Schwartz wrote on Friday after SVB was closed by regulators and as officials began examining how to respond to the largest bank failure since the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis.
The upcoming Fed session was already providing a reality check of sorts, as policymakers tried to understand why the rapid rate hikes of the last year have not had more impact on the pace of price increases.
The inflation rate in January actually rose, while an Atlanta Fed real-time projection as of March 8 showed gross domestic product expanding at a 2.6% annual rate, well above the economy's roughly 2% underlying potential.
Officials were poised to push the expected path of interest rates higher yet again as a result, the third time in their two-year battle against inflation that U.S. policymakers will have shifted on the fly after price increases proved to be faster, broader and more persistent than seen in their forecasts.
A February jobs report released Friday showed the unemployment rate rising to 3.6%. More importantly for the Fed, monthly wage growth slowed even as the economy continued to add jobs, an outcome that leaves open whether the Fed will approve a quarter or a half point rate increase at its next meeting. By late Sunday after the day's emergency actions, the probability of a half-point hike had diminished to below one-in-five.
New inflation data to be released Tuesday and retail sales data on Wednesday both have the potential to push policymakers in either direction at the two-day meeting, which concludes March 22 with a new Federal Open Market Committee statement and projections issued at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT), and a press conference by Powell at 2:30 p.m.
While investors at this point see lower odds of a return to larger rate hikes, there is still the question of just how much higher the Fed will go overall. Powell in his remarks to Congress last week signaled the new ""dot plot"" of projections for the rate path beyond March would likely be higher than previously expected in order to slow inflation to the central bank's 2% target from levels more than double that.
As of December the high point for the target federal funds rate was expected by most officials to be 5.1%. In their final public comments before the beginning of a pre-meeting blackout period, Fed officials other than Powell also said they were primed for a more aggressive response if upcoming data show them losing more ground on inflation.
""The ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,"" Powell said in congressional testimony that reset expectations for where the Fed was heading, and pushing yields on U.S. Treasury bonds higher and prompting a sell-off in equity markets.
At a Feb. 1 press conference, in contrast, his focus was on a ""disinflationary process"" he saw taking root.
Developments since then have raised some doubt in investors minds if Fed officials will follow through with that, however, and much of the immediate heat on bond yields and rate expectations eased after Friday's employment data, with the weekend's developments in the banking sector to address the Silicon Valley Bank collapse also factoring into the reversal.
Government reports released after Powell's last press conference showed the central bank's preferred measure of inflation had risen slightly to a 5.4% annual rate.
Revisions to prior months also erased some of the progress policymakers had relied on when they decided to step down to quarter point rate hikes at their last session. A New York Fed study last week suggested moreover that current inflation was being driven more by persistent factors and less by cyclical or sectoral influences that might be quicker to dissipate.
It is not the first time the Fed has been caught out by after-the-fact data updates. In the fall of 2021 the first release of monthly jobs reports seemed to show the job market weakening, taking some of the urgency out of discussions about when to start tightening monetary policy. By the end of the year revisions showed hundreds of thousands more jobs had been added than originally estimated.
""If you are trying to be nimble, this is the risk. And Powell is trying to be nimble,"" said former Fed economist John Roberts.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,Groq adapts Meta's chatbot for its own chips in race against Nvidia,Jane Lee,2023-03-09 23:18:00+00:00,,"OAKLAND, California, March 9 (Reuters) - Groq, a Silicon Valley chip startup founded by a former Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) engineer, said on Thursday it has adapted technology similar to the underpinnings of the wildly popular ChatGPT to run on its chips.
Groq modified LLaMA, a large language model released last month by Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc (META.O) that can be used to power bots to generate human-like text.
The move is significant because Meta's researchers originally developed LLaMA using chips from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), which has a market share of nearly 90% for AI computing according to some estimates. Showing that a cutting-edge model can be moved to Groq's chips easily could help the startup prove that its products are a viable alternative to Nvidia.
Groq has been trying to chip away at Nvidia's market share, along with startups such as SambaNova and Cerebras and big companies like Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O).
Efforts to find alternative chips to Nvidia's have gained extra steam with the popularity of ChatGPT which has focused attention on Nvidia's dominant role in AI. The public battle to dominate the AI technology space kicked off late last year with the launch of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT and prompted tech heavyweights from Alphabet to China's Baidu Inc (9888.HK) to trumpet their own offerings.

Meta made its code available to researchers for noncommercial use. Groq used Meta's model but stripped out the code that was included in order to make the model run on an Nvidia chip, Groq CEO Jonathan Ross told Reuters.
Groq then ran that model through Groq Compiler which automatically adds specific code for it to run on its own computing system. A compiler turns code into ones and zeros so a chip can read them.
Ross said the company's goal is to make it easy to move models from Nvidia's chips to its own. He said using the Groq system can also eliminate engineering effort each time changes are made to the LlaMA or other models to get it to work on the chips.
Meta Platforms declined to comment. The company has been working on making it easier for developers to use non-Nvidia chips and in October launched a set of free software tools for AI applications that enable switching back and forth between Nvidia and AMD chips.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,U.S. Chamber of Commerce calls for AI regulation,Reuters,2023-03-09 21:55:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/RXK4JAIYV5JQBJPG4RZT36LYQM.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday called for regulation of artificial intelligence technology to ensure it does not hurt growth or become a national security risk, a departure from the business lobbying group's typical anti-regulatory stance.
While there is little in terms of proposed legislation for AI, the fast-growing artificial intelligence program ChatGPT that has drawn praise for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries has raised U.S. lawmakers' concerns about its impact on national security and education.
The Chamber report argues policymakers and business leaders must quickly ramp up their efforts to establish a ""risk-based regulatory framework"" that will ensure AI is deployed responsibly.
It added that AI is projected to add $13 trillion to global economic growth by 2030 and that it has made important contributions such as easing hospital nursing shortages and mapping wildfires to speed emergency management officials' response. The report emphasized the need to be ready for the technology's looming ubiquity and potential dangers.

The report asserts that within 20 years, ""virtually every"" business and government agency will use AI.
A product of a commission on artificial intelligence that the Chamber established last year, the report is in part a recognition of the critical role the business community will play in the deployment and management of AI, the Chamber said.
Even as it calls for more regulation, the Chamber is careful to caveat that there may be broad exceptions to how regulation is applied.
""Rather than trying to develop a one size-fits-all regulatory framework, this approach to AI regulation allows for the development of flexible, industry-specific guidance and best practices,"" the report says.

Disrupted,/technology/disrupted/,OpenAI to enable more customizations for enterprise and individual users,Krystal Hu,2023-03-09 20:45:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FWJEJRQLOBO5RJW3UGCZZB3DTA.jpg,"March 9 (Reuters) - OpenAI, the creator of the buzzy chatbot ChatGPT, will release tools to give users more control over the generative AI system, while improving the models for both general and specific use cases, its CEO Sam Altman said Thursday.
Speaking to investors at a Morgan Stanley conference, Altman said the AI company will focus on building a platform that sells APIs to others and creates killer apps like ChatGPT.
Since its launch in November, ChatGPT's popularity has surged as traffic to the site hit more than 1 billion visits, up from 616 million in January, according to Similarweb estimates. OpenAI has launched a subscription tier of ChatGPT where users can pay $20 per month for more reliable services.
The Microsoft-backed company is working with enterprise clients to train its models in particular domains and has effectively reduced hallucinations, incidents when an AI system confidently gives a response that is factually incorrect, according to Altman.

Management consultancy Bain & Company, has struck a global services partnership with OpenAI, enabling Bain to embed AI in its client operations.
Enterprises that work with OpenAI can use their data and make a copy of the model to alleviate data safety concerns. Coca-Cola, for example, is working with OpenAI and Bain to use OpenAI's ChatGPT and DALL-E platforms to create personalized ad copy, images, and messaging.
Altman, a veteran entrepreneur and investor, said the company should be valued by investors as a firm to achieve the goal of general artificial intelligence.
Individual users should also have more control over how the AI works, Altman added. The company said last month it is developing an upgrade to its chatbot that users can customize to address concerns about bias in artificial intelligence.
""We'll launch more things soon that give users additional control on the system to behave this way or that way.""
Altman acknowledges the AI system cannot achieve 100% accuracy, and he said he expects applications including AI doctors and AI lawyers to emerge on people's phones soon.

Its headline earnings per share, a profit measure, was at 180.1 South African cents in the year to Dec. 31, up from 163.8 cents posted a year earlier.
Old Mutual, the largest life insurer in South Africa, has managed to recover following a tough two years due to COVID-19-led mortality claim and business interruptions.
But rising interest rates and tough domestic economic conditions such as daily power cuts have made the outlook risky for insurance firms.
""Failure to address load shedding will have an impact on crop failure, higher food prices and shortages of certain food products, which will further dampen economic growth,"" the company said.
It declared a dividend of 51 cents per share.

Business,/business/finance/,Canada's tech start ups face financing hurdles with SVB collapse,Maiya Keidan,2023-03-13 22:47:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/Y6KSXLOBA5OPJIJJXXCYGC6ML4.jpg,"TORONTO, March 13 (Reuters) - Last week's sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) could choke funding for Canada's technology start-ups and place them in the hands of domestic lenders who may be more selective in financing new ventures, financiers told Reuters.
That would be bad news for a sector that took a beating in 2022, which has made investors more risky averse in early stage investments.
""I would say this is probably the worst possible time (for this to happen) in the last decade because of the tech pullback we've had,"" said Neil Selfe, CEO at advisory INFOR Financial.
SVB's Canadian division, which received a license to operate in 2019, competed against other banks and private lenders to help finance the growth of the Canadian technology sector, before it collapsed on Friday. It had doubled its secured loans to C$435 million ($314 million) in 2022 from previous year.
Canada had come to be known as the world's second-biggest global tech hub in the world after Silicon Valley, Kim Furlong, CEO of Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association told CBC News on Monday.

Companies including Shopify Inc (SHOP.TO) were examples of Canada's tech success story, which helped pull more investments into the sector.
U.S. regulators stepped in on Sunday after the collapse of SVB, which had a run after a big bond portfolio hit.
CIBC (CM.TO), Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) and Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) were the most likely to pick up both SVB's current book, and future clients in Canada, John Ruffolo, Managing Partner Maverix Private Equity, a Toronto-based PE firm said.
All three banks have dedicated technology lending groups.
A spokesperson for RBC declined to comment while CIBC and BMO did not respond to requests for comment.
Selfe at INFOR Financial said while SVB Canada was a smaller player ""it was an important competitor in that market.""
""I think Canadian banks will continue to lend to earlier stage technology companies but without Silicon Valley Bank as a lender, I think they can afford to be much more selective in who they lend to and potentially increase the price at which they lend.""
Canada's top six banks already control more than 80% of the banking assets and the industry has come has attack from consumers advocates and politicians for its dominance.
Benjamin Bergen, president at Council of Canadian Innovators, a lobby group for Canadian technology companies, agreed.
""Before SVB went down, accessing capital was increasingly becoming tighter and tighter for Canadians for startups for scale ups,"" he said.
""And with this, really what we're hearing from the ecosystem is, you know, it is going to make it even more difficult, so that's really what we're monitoring.""
Canadian companies saw overall venture capital investment of C$1.3 billion ($947.38 million) so far this year, compared to C$4.5 billion over the first three months of 2022 and C$3.5 billion over the same period in 2021, according to Refinitiv data.
Funding environment for start-ups was already getting difficult due to rising interest rates. Investors were also turning selective due to the threat of a recession. Aside from the banks, the federal government also has a Venture Capital Catalyst Initiative program that invests in promising Canadian technology companies.

Business,/business/finance/,Analysis: The one pound rescue: inside the rush to save Silicon Valley Bank UK,Lawrence White,2023-03-14 06:00:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OWRPDCBMVZJ73FSFBCY7VQO37E.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - The swift collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, the nation's biggest bank failure since the financial crisis, initially caught Britain's regulators off guard. But within hours on Friday evening it was clear the window to rescue SVB's UK arm was tight.
Conversations with eight people involved in the discussions reveal the frantic nature of SVB UK's final hours, with at least half a dozen banks looking over the lender's numbers.
On Monday, HSBC (HSBA.L), Europe's largest bank with a balance sheet of almost $3 trillion, announced it was buying SVB UK for less than the price of a cup of coffee, emerging as a last-minute white knight after less than 24 hours spent scrutinising its books.
With assets of around 5.5 billion pounds and deposits of around 6.7 billion pounds, SVB UK is a minnow compared to HSBC. But concerns that SVB's potential failure could reverberate throughout the UK's start-up industry resulted in a hasty deal, sealed by deep pockets.

""Whether HSBC's acquisition proves to be successful will largely come down to the asset quality of the loan book, which cannot be assumed to be good, given the early-stage nature of many of the borrowers,"" said Jerry del Missier, former Chief Operating Officer at Barclays, and now Chief Investment Officer at Copper Street Capital.
While at least one bidder submitted a price above the symbolic one pound ($1.21) that HSBC offered, according to a source, HSBC was preferred because its size and resources meant it would be a more stable owner.
After a run on deposits, the Bank of England kick-started a scramble to salvage SVB UK while seeking insolvency in the event it could not find a buyer.
That complicated the rescue because NatWest, which operated as SVB UK's clearing bank in Britain, had stopped processing its transactions, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
The situation was urgent because SVB UK had lost almost half of its deposits in the 48 hours leading up to its rescue, the source said.
The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had also shut off access to the parent company's technology platform, the source said, meaning the potential bidders and treasury officials called both the FDIC and NatWest over the weekend to get SVB UK running again.
The FDIC did not respond to a request for comment, while NatWest declined to comment.
By late on Saturday afternoon, officials had contacted potential bidders to look more closely at SVB UK, giving them access to secure online vaults containing the lenders' financials, five sources with knowledge of the matter said.
As the crisis deepened, on Sunday morning finance minister Jeremy Hunt sought to reassure Silicon Valley Bank's customers in Britain that the government was working on a solution.
Banks including Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L), NatWest Group (NWG.L), Bank of London and OakNorth examined the books to see if an emergency deal could be reached, sources told Reuters.
At least one British bank was put off by some of the lending to the riskier startup sector which the U.S.-owned lender offered, an executive at the bank told Reuters.
For another bank, 75% of the book consisting of loans to private equity and venture capital funds was considered high quality, representing an opportunity.
Still, Treasury officials also continued to work on a ""Plan B"" in case a sale fell through, which could have seen Silicon Valley Bank UK broken up if no single buyer emerged, multiple sources involved with the talks said.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak battled inconsistent WiFi to remain in contact with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and finance minister Jeremy Hunt during a more than 15 hour flight to San Diego as the talks wore on.
HSBC's team including CEO Noel Quinn and UK CEO Ian Stuart began closer scrutiny of SVB UK that afternoon, a source familiar with the matter said.
Boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw - which has previously advised HSBC in its defence against a break-up call by its biggest shareholder - was drafted in an adviser by the bank over the weekend to help them on the SVB UK deal, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
By early evening on Sunday officials from the Treasury gave potential bidders a final 30 minutes to submit their offers, one of the sources directly involved in one of the bids said.
Officials from the Bank of England and Treasury along with board members from SVB UK were then locked in talks.
Meanwhile, in the U.S., regulators moved to protect SVB depositors, as well as implementing wider measures to shore up confidence in the banking system.
HSBC's CEO Quinn was attracted by the potential to bring on at a stroke some 3,000 high-growth technology and startup clients, a source familiar with his thinking told Reuters.
The purely nominal purchase price and SVB UK's underlying health meant the deal also made financial sense, the source said.
Still, HSBC could struggle to accurately value and run those loans due to their niche nature, said Xavier Van Hove, managing director of Nighthawk Partners, a specialist venture debt lender. HSBC also plans to inject 2 billion pounds of liquidity into SVB UK, a spokesperson for HSBC said.
Final preparations continued through Sunday night as the deal needed an exemption to Britain's ringfencing rules. Some of SVB UK's business customers are outside the UK while HSBC's UK ring-fenced business is meant to handle only British-based customers up to a certain size.
A spokesperson for the UK Cabinet Office referred comment to the Treasury Department. The Bank of England declined to comment. Advisory firm Rothschild, which advised SVB UK according to sources, also declined to comment.
The takeover and the US measures did little to assuage investors on Monday that the worst is over.
European bank shares saw their biggest rout since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the STOXX index of 600 lenders (.SX7P) falling nearly 6%.

Soaring sugar prices helped Tereos, one of the world's largest sugar makers in volume due to large activities in Brazil, to post strong profits in the last year, but high debts prompted the group to sell assets worldwide.
The group said last week it also planned to close a distillery and was seeking to sell a potato starch plant, both in eastern France.
In total the plans would cost 149 jobs, including the closure of its sugar-processing at Escaudoeuvres in northern France.
Since last week, workers have blocked the Escaudoeuvres factory, which has 40,000 tonnes of sugar inside and seeds for the upcoming harvest, union sources said.

At this time of year in France, sugar beet harvesting and sugar processing has finished for the season.
Despite soaring sugar prices, the area sown with beets is expected to fall to a 14-year low in France over the coming weeks as a ban on using neonicotinoid pesticides that are harmful to bees is deterring farmers from planting because they fear crop damage.
Tereos said its cooperative members had committed for 10% less beet.
But Industry Minister Roland Lescure said the decision to halt sugar output at the factory was premature.
""They are shouting 'fire' when they have not seen a single spark,"" Lescure told Sud Radio before travelling to the site. ""A company which earns money and which closes a factory, I think that is not normal.""
Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau last week asked Tereos to clarify the economic rationale behind its decision.

Icahn, who owns 1.4% of Illumina, told other investors in a letter on Monday that he plans to nominate three director candidates to the company's nine person board, after weeks of private discussions with the company ""failed to gain traction.""
Illumina in 2021 closed a deal to buy Grail, which develops cancer detection tests, in spite of antitrust opposition from the Federal Trade Commission in the United States and the European Union.
Icahn wants the board seats for fear that Illumina's current directors will ""pursue Grail until the end of time without regard to the amount of value destruction they leave in their wake."" The decision to close the deal in the face of European regulators objections ""created a staggering amount of risk,"" he wrote in the letter.
View 2 more stories 
The Icahn candidates - Vincent Intrieri, Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno - would help keep Illumina from ""sinking further.""
Illumina said CEO Francis deSouza and board chair John Thompson spoke with Icahn several times, and that his candidates were interviewed. But the company determined they lack ""relevant skills and experience.""
""Icahn was explicit and unyielding in his demand that any resolution should give him outsized influence and control,"" the company said in a statement.
The company also said that Icahn's letter does not recognize the value Grail can bring to Illumina shareholders.
Illumina's size shrunk from roughly $70 billion to $30 billion in market capitalization as investors worried about the takeover. On Monday, the stock jumped 16%.
The European Union in December unveiled details of a planned order which would force Illumina to unwind its $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail, fearing the deal would hurt consumer choice. While Illumina is appealing the planned order, it is also exploring options for next steps if the EU indeed forces it to divest Grail, it said.
Icahn said he fears the company could lose $800 million in operating costs annually if the Grail deal is not unwound.
Icahn's sabre rattling at Illumina lays the ground work for one of the year's most high profile proxy contests after Nelson Peltz ended his contest for a seat at Disney and Daniel Loeb reached and agreement with Bath & Body Works. A handful of activists are still pressuring Salesforce to make changes.
At age 87, the billionaire remains one of the industry's most feared activist investors after having taken on iconic American companies including CVR Energy and Netflix (NFLX.O) over decades as an investor.

Brent crude futures fell $1.64, or 2%, to $79.13 a barrel by 1001 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) dropped $1.74, or 2.3%, to $73.06 a barrel. On Monday, Brent and WTI fell to their lowest since early January and December, respectively.
Oil prices dropped alongside a continued slide in equities markets (.MIWD00000PUS).
""We see Monday’s developments around the regional U.S. banks as more noise than news for commodity markets, and it should not have any meaningful medium- to longer-term impact,"" said UBS analyst Carsten Menke.

Traders now no longer expect a 50-basis points (bps) rate hike next week, with a current projection of a 25 bps rise, even ahead of the release of U.S. consumer price data on Tuesday.
A lower rate rise could mean the dollar weakening  which in turn is a bullish signal for oil prices.
Economists surveyed by Reuters forecast consumer prices increased by 0.4% in February, which would lower the year-on-year increase in the CPI to 6.0% in February and mark the smallest year-on-year rise since September 2021.
A stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation outcome could put further downward pressure on oil prices.

The budget proposal aimed at boosting tax enforcement and collections comes on top of a fiscal 2024 appropriations request of $14.1 billion, marking an increase of $1.8 billion, or 15% over the 2023 IRS budget.
The additional IRS funding requests contained in President Joe Biden's budget plan announced on Thursday drew the ire of Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee, where Yellen testified on Friday. The budget includes hefty tax increases on wealthy Americans and corporations to bring down deficits over the coming decade.
""You already got $80 billion for the IRS. Now you want $43.2 billion more, all without explaining what will be done with the first $80 billion,"" said Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, adding the two budget requests.

""The American people, they deserve to know how their hard earned tax dollars are being spent and the impact that a supercharged IRS will have on them,"" the Missouri Republican added.
Yellen said she would unveil ""in the coming weeks"" a promised spending plan for the $80 billion in IRS investments approved last year as part of the climate and healthcare-focused Inflation Reduction Act.
The additional $29.1 billion in long-term enforcement investments would add two more years to the $80 billion program for 2032 and 2033, according to the budget. The Treasury estimates that this would produce an additional $105 billion in net revenue from collections during those two years.
Republicans fear that the IRS will hire an ""army"" of 87,000 agents and harass small business owners with onerous audits, claims denied by Yellen.
She repeated her vow not to use the IRS investment funds, aimed at rebuilding the IRS' audit capabilities after more than a decade of budget cuts under past Republican-controlled Congresses, to increase audit rates for Americans and small businesses earning less than $400,000.
Yellen also said that the ""vast majority"" of hiring at the agency from the $80 billion would go towards replacing retiring employees over the next decade.

Business,/business/sustainable-business/,EU seeks to arrest industry decline in green transition,Philip Blenkinsop,2023-03-10 19:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/POHOEJAXT5KR7AYYPH5RA7RWNM.jpg,"BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Union is a global frontrunner in cutting carbon emissions but is also moving to ensure the green transition doesn't make it an industrial desert, with a raft of measures due to be announced next week.
Europe's industrial competitiveness in relation to the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, has become a major concern across the bloc 30 years after it created its borderless single market, which some say is now due for a major revamp.
Next week's announcements include legislative proposals to facilitate domestic production of key supplies and streamline grants for green projects, and also address the divisive issue of state aid. They come before a summit of EU leaders on March 23-24 to discuss and guide the EU response.
Many in the EU are worried that U.S. President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which offers $369 billion of green subsidies that often only apply to products made in North America, could lure companies out of Europe, allowing the United States to grow into a clean tech giant at Europe's expense.
View 2 more stories 
EU internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton said this week it was clear that both the United States and China were seeking to attract industrial capacity away from Europe and so make Europe dependent on their industries in future: ""Or to put it more bluntly - they are engaged in a subsidies race. Not us; them.""
The EU likes to see itself as a champion on tackling climate change with its goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 and tough 2030 emissions targets, with progress on that front ahead of efforts in the United States and China.
But while it holds strong positions in certain green sectors, it risks being outpaced in technology.
On patents in key future digital and green technologies, Europe lags the United States across the board, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute which showed that both were behind China and other east Asian countries in clean tech.
The supply of minerals vital for the green transition is a further challenge, with China processing almost 90% of rare earths and 60% of lithium, a key element for batteries.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has reinforced a lesson learned during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely that the EU cannot rely on a single supplier for essential materials, whether personal protective equipment or oil and gas.
The pandemic already led to calls for EU ""strategic autonomy"" - though opened up a debate as to whether that meant producing essential goods in the bloc or diversifying supplies.
On the former, the EU executive will propose legislation on Tuesday enabling the region to mine 10% of the strategic raw materials it consumes and increase processing to 40% of its needs by 2030.
On the latter, the Commission believes trade deals with the likes of Chile and Australia, the two largest producers of lithium, could ensure direct supply and reduce reliance on China.
It will also make proposals to streamline the granting of permits for green projects, which at present can take many years, and foster investment in net-zero industry ""valleys"".
Then there is the thorny question of subsidies and a possible future European Sovereignty Fund, an idea first raised by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last year.
Both topics are divisive. Backed by France and Germany, the Commission has proposed easing state aid rules to allow green investment, which could extend to matching subsidies offered elsewhere for net-zero technologies.
Some EU countries complain they will not be able to match the sums offered by the EU's two largest economies.
Breton argues the sovereignty fund would help ensure a level playing field between EU countries that do not have the same ability to provide state aid, with financing through joint borrowing.
But northern EU members led by Germany have already warned against new common debt, highlighting there are still unused funds from the bloc's 800 billion euro ($847.60 billion) pandemic recovery fund.
Countries such as the Netherlands, the Nordics, the Czech Republic and Ireland have also warned of the risk of excessive, blanket subsidies and say work to improve the EU single market would be more effective.
Often called the crown jewel of European integration, the EU single market launched in 1993 has been a game-changer for the free movement of goods but has done less to stimulate other parts of the economy.
""If you look at what we have today in terms of the single market for goods it's highly effective, it makes the EU very competitive globally and we need to try to do the same for services and digital in particular,"" Irish Trade Minister Simon Coveney said at a meeting with EU counterparts on Friday.

Business,/business/energy/,BP CEO pay more than doubles to $12 million; emissions unchanged,Shadia Nasralla,2023-03-10 10:55:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OMYWHH5YNFM5FOFA62V76GAO54.jpg,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) CEO Bernard Looney's 2022 pay packet more than doubled to around $12 million on the back of bumper profits amid spiralling energy prices, while BP's emissions were broadly unchanged, its annual report showed on Friday.
BP reported a record profit of $28 billion for 2022 and hiked its dividend, but infuriated climate activists by rowing back on plans to slash oil and gas output and reduce carbon emissions by 2030.
Looney's base salary of 1.3 million pounds was topped up by retirement benefits and performance-related elements including an annual bonus and shares to 10.03 million pounds ($11.99 million), more than double the 4.46 million pounds he was awarded in 2021.
The ex-CEO of energy rival Shell (SHEL.L), Ben van Beurden, saw his pay package rise 53% to 9.7 million pounds after Shell reported record profits of $40 billion.

""Instead of allowing these huge payouts to end up in the pockets of CEOs, the government must step in with a proper tax on the oil industry and its profits, channel the money into stopping energy waste from homes, and invest in green heating schemes,"" said Greenpeace UK’s head of climate Mel Evans.
BP's shares were down around 2% at 547 pence at 1042 GMT compared with a 1.2% drop for an index of European oil and gas firms (.SXEP).
BP's emissions in 2022 were broadly unchanged from the previous year at around 340 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, according to its annual report and Reuters calculations.
Unlike Shell, BP in its figures excludes emissions from fuels it sells that are derived from crude oil it does not produce.
BP has already achieved its 2025 aim of reducing its well-to-forecourt emissions by 10-15% against a 2019 baseline. By 2030 it aims to cut these by 20-30% and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
BP said it would stick to these targets despite increasing its hydrocarbon production through to 2025. It plans to reduce its oil and gas output by a quarter by 2030.
Rival Shell, the world's biggest fuel retailer, reported 2022 emissions of around 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2e, including planet-warming gases from the combustion of all fuel it sells regardless of the origin of the crude oil it is refined from.
In comparison, Britain's emissions come to around 400 million tonnes CO2 equivalent a year.
The carbon intensity of the energy products BP sold last year was broadly stable at 77 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule, the same as Shell's.
This measure includes all energy BP sells including fuel originally produced by other companies.
Measuring emissions performance by intensity means a company can technically increase its fossil fuel output and overall emissions while using offsets or adding renewable energy or biofuels to its product mix.

Business,/business/sustainable-business/,CERAWEEK-Britain to announce new CCS support within days -minister,Ron Bousso,2023-03-09 22:32:00+00:00,,"HOUSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The British government will outline within days incentives for companies to bury their greenhouse gases deep underground, using a promising technology for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide, a minister said on Thursday.
Britain aims to use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to hold 20 million to 30 million tonnes of carbon by 2030 as part of its strategy to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050.
CCS involves filtering planet-warming carbon gases from industrial smokestacks before they hit the atmosphere and storing them underground, usually in porous reservoirs.
""There is no route that we can reach net zero without carbon capture, hydrogen and nuclear,"" Graham Stuart, Minister of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, told Reuters.
Acknowledging previous mistakes in efforts to support CCS, Stuart said the government is ""determined there aren't going to be missteps in the future and you will hear in days further announcements on that, including government support to make sure that carbon capture is unlocked.""

Business,/business/energy/,Factbox: Biden budget targets U.S. fossil fuel subsidies,Reuters,2023-03-09 21:59:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/F7V3LOA4GZKHRBN43RIQ422JIA.jpg,"March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden proposed a budget on Thursday that would scrap billions of dollars in oil and gas industry subsidies reviving a perennial debate about whether fossil fuel companies should be receiving lucrative tax breaks.
While the proposal has little chance of making it through a divided Congress, it represents a political signal from the White House, which has repeatedly criticized Big Oil for raking in record profits at a time of high consumer energy costs since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Here are some details about U.S. fossil fuel subsidies:
Calculating the cost of U.S. subsidies for the fossil fuel industry is complex because the incentives stretch across the U.S. tax code, but estimates range from $10 to $50 billion per year.
Axing the subsidies would save the government nearly $31 billion over 10 years, Biden's fiscal year 2024 budget proposal says.
Taxpayer advocates and environmental groups argue the subsidies are inappropriate at a time when the federal government is trying to shift the economy to cleaner forms of energy to fight climate change.

The oil industry counters that the support is needed to ensure ongoing investment and reliable supply.
U.S. oil and gas subsidies include provisions ranging from incentives for domestic production, write-offs and deductions tied to foreign production and income, and approved accounting methods that can reduce the stated taxable value of assets.
One specific U.S. tax break on domestic production, for example, called intangible drilling costs, allows producers to deduct a majority of their costs from drilling new wells. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan panel of Congress, has estimated that eliminating it could generate $13 billion for the public coffers over 10 years.
Another, the percentage depletion tax break, which allows independent producers to recover development costs of declining oil gas and coal reserves, could generate about $12.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to the panel.
Before taking office, Biden promised to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies as part of a multi-pronged effort to fight climate change that also included ending new drilling on public lands.
These promises have been impossible to keep. For one, they require an act of Congress, and Republicans and some Democrats oppose the removal of fossil fuel subsidies. Secondly, soaring energy prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have led Biden to call for more oil and gas, not less.
Ending subsidies for oil and gas is not a new idea, but it has always been difficult: former President Barack Obama also wanted to ditch tax breaks for fossil fuels to show the world that the United States was serious about speeding a transition to clean energy to tackle climate change.
But even with a commanding Democratic majority in the Senate during Obama's first six years in office, he was unable to kill the subsidies.
Lance West, a vice president of government relations at the American Petroleum Institute lobbying group, said the budget shows contradictions in Biden's energy policy. ""The White House calls for increasing American oil and natural gas to meet consumer demands and then fails to issue leases and discourages future investment by proposing new discriminatory taxes,"" West said.
For many governments, keeping consumer energy prices affordable is the top priority. That's why numerous countries, ranging from Japan to Brazil, last year imposed or increased subsidies to cushion consumers from skyrocketing prices.
The International Energy Agency estimated that so-called consumption subsidies for fossil fuels doubled in 2022 to $1 trillion globally.

Business,/business/energy/,CERAWEEK-Renewable natural gas land grab ends as suppliers turn to sales,David French,2023-03-09 18:25:00+00:00,,"HOUSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The land grab for the best sites to gather renewable natural gas (RNG) from landfills and dairy farms is largely over, executives said this week at the CERAWeek energy conference, as developers turn to marketing the fuel for uses including in transportation and power generation.
RNG, methane derived from biological waste, is prized for its potential to replace natural gas and reduce climate-warming emissions otherwise released into the atmosphere.
BP Plc (BP.L) made a splash last year by spending $4.1 billion on RNG firm Archaea Energy. There also have been smaller deals as well as joint ventures kicked off by companies including Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Republic Services Inc (RSG.N) and Clean Energy Fuels Corp (CLNE.O).
Investors had paid up to secure the biggest sites in a move compared to the huge sums paid last decade for land in the most productive U.S. shale oil and gas fields, executives said.
View 2 more stories 
""If you look back at the last five years in shale, with the race to secure the best acreage, and what people were willing to pay to do that, you've seen a lot of the same in RNG,"" Brian Hlavinka, a vice president at gas pipeline operator Williams Companies Inc (WMB.N), said this week.
""What we've seen now is a calming of those waters,"" he said.
Having secured supplies, RNG backers are looking to tap new markets.
Scott Pearl, a principal at investment firm Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), said RNG could be used in gas-fired power plants which are only turned on during periods of peak demand - known as ""peaker plants"" in the industry.
Steve Caldwell, a vice president at utility National Grid (NG.L), said RNG can be added to natural gas used to heat homes to partially reduce the overall emissions produced.
RNG is now used as a fuel. Companies like landfill operator Waste Management (WM.N) and retailer Walmart Inc (WMT.N) use RNG for their trucks fleets.
However, supplies of RNG are limited and its price substantially higher than traditional natural gas, which was trading on Thursday around $2.60 a million British thermal units, about a third of what gas fetched last summer.
The RNG market contributes 180-200 million cubic feet per day, a fraction of this year's projected 100.34 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas from drilling, Williams' Hlavinka said.
The amount of RNG which can be integrated into the energy system is limited by the fact there are only so many farms and landfills, meaning it will never have enough scale to replace traditional natural gas.
""RNG's not going to solve decarbonization for natural gas,"" said GIP's Pearl, estimating the maximum potential supply at somewhere between 5 bcfd and 10 bcfd.

Business,/business/energy/,"CERAWEEK-Don’t let China control clean energy supply chain, US officials warn",Richard Valdmanis,2023-03-09 21:54:00+00:00,,"HOUSTON, March 9 - Officials from President Joe Biden's administration warned leaders of the U.S. clean energy transition this week to decarbonize quickly and keep the supply chain out of China's control.
Washington's message at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston reflects growing concern that the rapid investment it is encouraging to fight climate change could backfire if it empowers China. Many executives agreed, but said the U.S. had to find a way to ensure domestic supply without sparking a trade war with the world's second biggest economy, already a dominant supplier of critical minerals and components used in everything from electric vehicle batteries to solar panels.
U.S. tensions with Beijing have been rising over issues ranging from Chinese spying to Taiwan's status and China's position on Russia's war in Ukraine.
""It's just clear, to say it directly, that China has too much of a chokehold on critical minerals, on critical processing and upstream technologies, and solar,"" White House energy adviser John Podesta told the conference.
""We let that go. That was a mistake. We need to get it back.""
View 2 more stories 
He and other officials at the conference cited Europe's historic reliance on Russian fuel as an example of risks of relying on global rivals. State Department energy envoy Amos Hochstein and Under Secretary Jose Fernandez were among officials giving speeches or participating in panel discussions.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine Feb. 24, 2022, Moscow has cut natural gas supplies to Europe. Soaring energy costs forced Europe's industry and consumers to cut consumption, while governments and utilities scrambled to find alternative supplies.
Europe will remain vulnerable for years to spikes in global gas prices caused by even small gas supply outages, executives and officials at the conference said.
As the world moves toward a low-carbon economy, Podesta told attendees, ""We need to make sure the supply chains are secure, that we don't have a repeat of what we saw with the Russian chokehold on fossil fuels.""
Hochstein said the United States needs to ""learn the lessons from the previous era, the 20th century fossil industry, and make sure we have as much production at home and make sure that the supply chains are secure.""
The Biden administration has encouraged domestic clean energy manufacturing investment. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, provides hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives to companies opening new projects on American soil.
Despite U.S. comments encouraging a decoupling in trade with China, the two countries in recent months have made more energy supply deals related to natural gas.
Energy executives agreed on the value of a diverse and secure supply chain. But some said the clean energy transition would be smoother if Washington could keep trade flowing and relations friendly with China, where products are often cheaper.
""I’m real worried about the U.S. not finding a way to talk to China. I think it’s very important for the future of the world and reducing CO2 that, on an issue as critical as climate, we need to be able to – at least – talk together,"" said Andy Marsh, CEO of hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power (PLUG.O).
""On the other side, I think nations need to think about their own energy independence, and it’s really important for us liberal democracies to make sure we have integrated, diversified supply chains,"" he said.
In the mining industry, tensions with China could dampen investment in long-term projects, including in China itself, said Richard Adkerson, CEO of miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX.N).
""The situation with China is very complicated and clearly if the situation ... resulted in a major trade war between the U.S. and China, it would have an impact on the world's economy broadly,"" he said.
That risk ""is overhanging our industry right now. It's another factor that makes companies reluctant to initiate investments in long-term projects to meet the coming demand for copper,"" he said. Copper, used in everything from electric vehicles to the power lines and transmission grids, is essential to an increasingly electrified society.
The United States could not possibly become completely independent from China-made components such as electrolyzers for hydrogen production, batteries and solar panels, said Takajiro Ishikawa, CEO of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Americas.
""There has to be a lot more cooperation between nations,"" he said. ""For America to win its challenge against climate change, you cannot build everything in Japan or America.""
The world's two top economies need to combine their industrial and political power to build the energy industry of the future, some participants said.
""China and U.S. have to engage on this,"" said Mark Hutchinson, CEO of Fortescue Future Industries.
""Trade conquers all at the end of the day.""

OPEC expects Chinese oil demand to grow by 710,000 bpd in 2023, up from last month's forecast of 590,000, although the global total was steady due to downward revisions elsewhere.

Business,/business/finance/,Venture capitalists weigh 'long-shot plan' to preserve parts of SVB -FT,Reuters,2023-03-13 23:26:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/34CFBJ7RSBL2PEMXZFNABHYX3U.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - Venture capital firms are working on a ""long-shot plan"" to preserve parts of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in a move to keep servicing their clients in the technology sector, the Financial Times reported on Monday citing people briefed on the effort.
A group of several VC firms are in talks since late last week about how to enable SVB to continue lending to, investing in and advising companies and executives in the sector, the FT reported, adding General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Venture are among the firms involved in talks.
Forming a consortium with Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) that could bid for portions of SVB is one of the proposals being discussed, the newspaper quoted people as saying.

Business,/business/finance/,Euro zone bank supervisors see limited hit from SVB collapse,Reuters,2023-03-13 15:09:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VQAYTQS2N5M7JK7UXFANOCD4RM.jpg,"FRANKFURT, March 13 (Reuters) - Euro zone supervisors see limited consequences for banks in the region from the collapse of two U.S. lenders, while stressing the need to watch any further spillover closely.
Investors were selling euro zone bank shares and reeling in their bets on interest rate increases by the European Central Bank after Silicon Valley Bank became the largest U.S. bank to fail since the global financial crisis of 2008, prompting U.S. authorities to step in.
But a senior European Central Bank supervisor said euro zone banks were well funded and more conservative than SVB, which mostly lent to tech startups, and New York-based rival Signature Bank , which was wound down at the weekend.
The source said supervisors saw no direct implication of the SVB collapse for euro zone banks but cautioned this could change if the fallout in the United States extended to bigger banks, raising the risk of contagion.

For now, however, the ECB's Supervisory Board, which oversees the euro zone's biggest bank, did not see the need to hold an emergency meeting, the source added.
Among national authorities, which are responsible for smaller banks, only Germany's Bundesbank had formally convened its crisis team.
This was created at the time of the last financial crisis and is tasked with informing the Bundesbank's board and making recommendations, but it doesn't have the power to take decisions.
Germany's financial regulator BaFin, which supervises German banks in cooperation with the Bundesbank, said it was imposing a moratorium on the German branch of SVB.
A spokesperson for the ECB declined to comment while a spokesperson for the Banque de France said it didn't have a crisis meeting in the works.
Yet investors were worried, even calling into question the ECB's clearly telegraphed 50-basis-point hike this Thursday.
Money markets were now pricing in a 60% chance of the ECB raising rates by just 25 basis points, reflecting concern that market instability would get in the way of the central bank's fight against inflation.
An index of shares in euro zone banks (.SX7E) had fallen by 7% by 1320 GMT, with Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) down 15% and Spain's Sabadell (SABE.MC) down 10.7%.
The supervisory source added euro zone banks had done a good job of transferring assets from their trading books to their ""hold-to-maturity"" portfolio, meaning they didn't have to account for lower market prices as a result of rising interest rates.
Marco Troiano, a director at Scope Ratings, noted that euro zone supervisors applied the strictest liquidity requirements to all banks with more than 30 billion euros worth of assets while their U.S. peers set the threshold at 250 billion dollars.
Silicon Valley Bank, which suffered a bank run last week, had approximately $209 billion in total assets.
""The supervision of mid-sized banks in Europe is stronger, including on funding and liquidity,"" Troiano said. ""There has not been a rollback of post-crisis regulations in Europe, unlike in the U.S."".
Morgan Stanley analysts also estimated that euro zone banks wouldn't be forced to sell bonds at a loss thanks to their existing cash buffers.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said there was ""no specific alert on the French banking system, which is solid"" but he was ""monitoring the situation"".
The Italian finance ministry said it trusted European authorities would intervene ""with the same timeliness"" as their U.S. counterpart if needed.
There is a key difference however: the United States has a single deposit insurance scheme, which was activated on Monday to rescue SVB's customers, while each of the 20 countries that share the euro has its own and its capacity is ultimately constrained by each national government's ability to bail out its depositors.

Asked about HSBC's white knight role, Hunt said the finance ministry had been neutral as to what the solution for SVB's UK arm was, and his priority was to avoid using British taxpayer money.
""We were looking at all options and we needed to be sure that if the sale didn't happen, we had other solutions ready,"" he said.

Business,/business/autos-transportation/,Hyundai Motor lines up to buy General Motors' India plant,Aditi Shah,2023-03-13 12:21:00+00:00,,"NEW DELHI, March 13 (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) said on Monday it has agreed to a potential acquisition of General Motors' (GM.N) plant in India, a move that could finally allow the U.S. automaker to exit a country where it stopped making cars in 2017.
A final deal is subject to meeting certain conditions including obtaining ""regulatory approvals from relevant government authorities and all stakeholders related to the acquisition"", Hyundai said in a statement.
GM stopped selling cars in India in 2017 after years of dwindling sales but its complete exit from the market has been marred by complications, including legal tussles with workers and the failure to find a buyer for the plant which is in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.
In 2019, GM agreed to sell the plant to China's Great Wall Motor (601633.SS) but talks collapsed last year after the companies failed to obtain regulatory approvals amid New Delhi's increased scrutiny of investments from Beijing.

GM and its factory workers - who allege illegal termination after the company decided to exit - have also been locked in legal battles since 2021. In the latest setback, in January, a union sued GM's India unit and its global CEO for failing to pay court-ordered compensation to sacked factory workers.
GM has previously said its employees have been legally separated and it remains confident of its legal position.
India has been a tough battleground for Western carmakers, especially U.S. companies, that have struggled to break the dominance of Japan's Suzuki Motor (7269.T) and South Korea's Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), which together hold 60% market share. Like GM, Ford Motor (F.N), too, ceased operations in India.
This acquisition will give Hyundai a second plant in India allowing the carmaker to boost production capacity at a time when it plans to launch six electric vehicles in India by 2028.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) had given a Sunday afternoon deadline for bids for the failed bank, one of the sources said. Reuters could not determine which banks had bid.
The banks and the FDIC declined comment.
The FDIC has been trying to find a buyer for Silicon Valley Bank this weekend after taking control of it on Friday so that the bank's corporate clients that had their money frozen can meet their payroll obligations. But a deal on a tight timeline has proven to be hard. Bids were due for SVB at 2:00 pm ET (1800 GMT), two of the sources said.
PNC, one of the 10 largest U.S. banks by assets, wanted to pursue a bid for the entirety of Silicon Valley Bank, one of the sources added, but then studied a bid for parts of Silicon Valley Bank. A separate source familiar with the matter said PNC had decided to withdraw from any further talks.

RBC also explored a takeover of Silicon Valley Bank but it was unlikely to pursue it, three sources said. One of the sources added that RBC has struggled to get comfortable with the risks involved and the complexities of justifying the deal to regulators in its home country of Canada. RBC bought City National Bank in 2015. It is the eighth largest bank by deposits in California, according to FDIC data.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Sunday ruled out a government bailout of Silicon Valley Bank and said she was working with regulators to find a solution.

The British bank has appointed investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP.O) to advise it on its interest in Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited (SVB UK), the report said, citing a source familiar with the matter.
The Bank of London declined to comment on the report, while SVB did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
The news of the British bank's bid interest comes a day after the Bank of England said it was seeking a court order to place SVB UK into an insolvency procedure, after U.S. regulators took over its parent company SVB Financial Group earlier on Friday.
The rout in SVB's stock, which began on Thursday, has spilled over into other U.S. and European banks. U.S. banks have lost over $100 billion in stock market value and European banks have shed another $50 billion in value over the past two days, according to a Reuters calculation.

Business,/business/finance/,SVB fall casts shadow on early-stage U.S. biotech,Patrick Wingrove,2023-03-13 22:58:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/EUR6IHDRRJOHTIWYBRKIYSWN6U.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) will leave early-stage biotechnology companies with a funding void, investors and analysts said on Monday, but larger, publicly-traded drug companies should escape unscathed.
About 50% of U.S. biotech companies, developing drugs for everything from cancer to heart disease and rare conditions, banked with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), including a large number of private firms, according to WBB financial analyst and managing partner Steve Brozak.
Analysts said the direct impact to U.S. biotech companies overall was limited, although several drugmakers such as Axsome Therapeutics Inc (AXSM.O) and Rhythm Pharmaceuticals Inc (RYTM.O) disclosed cash deposits with the bank. Vir Biotechnology Inc (VIR.O) had some $220 million with SVB.
""It's a pretty profound situation. Everyone that has been in the (biotech) business has amassed respect for SVB as a brand both on the commercial side as well as the investment banking side,"" said Robert Williamson, chief business officer at Triumvira Immunologics, which does not have exposure to SVB.

Startup-focused lender SVB Financial Group last week became the largest bank to fail since the 2008 financial crisis, sending shockwaves through the global financial system and prompting regulators to step in to contain the fallout.
Analysts said the situation would have been far worse for biotechs had the U.S. government not stepped in over the weekend and promised depositors would have access to their money on Monday.
SVB’s demise likely leaves smaller biotech clients without an alternative lender, said Brozak, since other banks will now probably raise their funding thresholds to points that make investment difficult for smaller entities.
“Where are they going to get their money?"" said Brozak, with one of the industry's major lenders out of the game.
One healthcare investor who spoke on condition of anonymity said SVB’s absence meant fewer companies financed and biotechs paring back pipelines of medicines in development. “There’s definitely going to be a winnowing of the herd,” he said.
The full effect of SVB’s collapse on the sector may not be seen for some time because of the different reporting requirements for SVB’s non-public borrowers.
While public companies have to disclose their exposure in deposits, loans and liabilities with SVB, in line with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s major event reporting requirements, private companies can decide whether or not to tell investors about the level of harm suffered.

FINMA said it was also monitoring for any spill-over effects from the failure of another tech-focused U.S. bank, Silvergate Capital Corp (SI.N), which said on Wednesday it was planning to wind down its operations and liquidated voluntarily.
The regulator said its supervisory activities were focused on the risk management of supervised institutions and on dealing with various scenarios.
Switzerland's Federal Department of Finance said it ""takes note of the reports on US banks and the development of the stock markets"" but would not be further commenting on them.
The government department also pointed to FINMA's role and said ""FINMA is closely monitoring Credit Suisse as part of its supervisory activities.""

""It is important to have the right combination, the right mix of capital,"" Giacoman said about Clara's recent bet on debt financing over new equity rounds, having previously raised capital from funds such as Coatue and monashees.
The executive noted that the move allowed the firm to separate money used to increase liquidity solutions for customers from that used to invest in team and products. But he did not rule out new announcements on the equity side in the future as well.

""The actions by the Fed to shore up the banking system with its new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), is a decisive step. It will help stem volatility and significantly limit the threat of contagion. By allowing banks to post Treasuries and other government debt at par, (it) will help lenders avoid distress sales and in turn honor deposits.
""The program is not a bail-out. Shareholders and unsecured debtholders will not be covered and in turn will likely see their positions take a significant hit. As a result, this program can be implemented immediately.
""Regional banks were seeing significant stress as markets worried about a knock on. This move by the Fed affirms the resiliency of the system and that it has a clear plan to assure liquidity and support deposit holders.
ALVIN TAN, HEAD OF ASIA FX STRATEGY, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, SINGAPORE:
""Markets remain unsettled from the SVB failure. US and UK regulators have stepped in to contain the fallout.
""The market turbulence sparked by SVB has upended rising market expectations on the Fed rate path. We have US CPI due on Tuesday, which adds to the uncertainty over the FOMC (Fed) meeting next week with the market pulling back from expecting a 50bp hike. The situation is evolving, but volatility looks set to remain elevated in coming days.
ANTHONY SAGLIMBENE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL, TROY, MICHIGAN:
""It was imperative that regulators stepped in and decisively acted before markets around the world opened for the week. The fact that SVB and Signature Bank depositors will be made whole is critical in maintaining trust in the financial system and should help stem contagion fears this week. But Yellen made very clear today that the government will not bail out bank shareholders and some unsecured creditors, which should make taxpayers happy.
""In addition, the Fed's facility to offer loans to banks that may see similar issues to SVB should also go a long way in helping back depositors and safeguard the financial system.""
""The actions taken by regulators should go a long way to assuaging the important concerns about deposits and customers' ability to meet payroll and other obligations.
""It's certainly a stress relief in the short-term, and we can worry about moral hazard and lax regulation later.
""But it's too soon to give an all clear. Stock and bond holders in SVB and Signature are likely wiped out. That's a lot of money that simply evaporated, which has to hurt someone. It won't fully remove the worries about what other banks might be in trouble.
""Long story short, (it's) good news for depositors and markets in the short-term, but I don't think we're fully out of the woods. But it also means that 50 basis points (a possible Fed interest rate hike) is off the table.""
CAROL KONG, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA.
""Currency markets are still digesting all the news related to the collapse of SVB. The measures announced this morning seem to have calmed markets for now and we are seeing some recovery in risk currencies. Given all the measures taken by the authorities markets should be calmer at least for the time being, but if concerns about regional banks, we could easily see the dollar and Japanese yen rally again.
""From the perspective of the FOMC, their concern is still inflation and inflation has not really decelerated. Tomorrow's CPI will continue to show that inflation remains persistently high. Given what's happened in the U.S. financial system, a 25 basis point hike is more likely than a 50 basis point hike.""
MATHAN SOMASUNDARAM, FOUNDER, DEEP DATA ANALYTICS, SYDNEY:
""Even if they bail them out, it's basically saying that most of these banks are carrying much higher risk than most people thought.
Referring to whether it could change the Federal Reserve's rate tightening path, he said: ""Before these bank collapses you would have thought 50 basis points was in play? Does these banks rolling over change that? I don't think so. At the end of the day, the whole idea of what the Fed was doing was eventually going to break things.
""The fact that at the first sign of something breaking, everyone screams bailout, is a bit premature. The Fed cannot do bailouts or rate cuts or any kind of pivot 'till they get inflation down so in theory they have to keep tightening and let the weakness play out.""
JUN BEI LIU, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TRIBECA INVESTMENT PARTNERS, SYDNEY:
""It was a big failure and clearly caused investors concern, but we thought it was very company-specific and about exposure to the pointy end (of markets). It's not a systemic issue, at least at this point
""If the Fed is going to protect the depositor, its probably nothing beyond what's happening to companies directly involved.""
KARL SCHAMOTTA, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CORPAY, TORONTO:
""We think the steps taken by the Fed, Treasury and FDIC will decisively break the psychological 'doom loop' across the regional banking sector - and should help negate the likelihood of a funding squeeze in global markets. But, fairly or not, the episode will contribute to higher levels of background volatility, with investors watching warily for other cracks to emerge as the Fed's policy tightening continues.
""Terminal rate expectations should remain below the peaks reached during Powell's testimony last Tuesday, with a more cautious approach likely in the aftermath of this meltdown.""
SHANE OLIVER, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY, AMP CAPITAL, SYDNEY:
""There is going to be a lot of to'ing and fro'ing in the market in the next little while to see if the measures work. The market is still quite nervous and this will take time to play out.
""It seems investors are on edge thinking if this bank has hit trouble, maybe there are others that will be in trouble, too. If it turns out to be a storm in a teacup and it's over in a week, then the Fed next week will return to what it does which is looking at data and contemplating a 25 or 50 basis point increase in rates. If there are still reverberations, then it would be hard to do a 50 basis points hike even if CPI and retail sales figures justify it.""
NICOLAS VERON, SENIOR FELLOW, THE PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS, WASHINGTON:
""This is a bailout and a major change of the way in which the U.S. system was built and its incentives. The cost will be passed on to everyone who uses banking services.
It's possible that the issue is that deposits have never moved so fast and that is what formed the basis of this decision – the outflows at SVB were without equivalent.
If all bank deposits are now insured, why do you need banks? This could feed into the debate about central bank digital currencies.""
ECONOMISTS AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS:
""These are strong moves. In particular, the shift to accepting collateral at par rather than marking to market means that the banks that have accumulated more than $600 billion in unrealised losses on their held-to-maturity Treasury and MBS securities portfolios – and didn't hedge the interest rate risk – should be able to ride out the storm.
""Rationally, this should be enough to stop any contagion from spreading and taking down more banks, which can happen in the blink of an eye in the digital age. But contagion has always been more about irrational fear, so we would stress that there is no guarantee this will work.""
HOWARD NEEDLE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT WELLESLEY ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK:
""In the short-term a bailout should reduce panic but longer term it can't be great for the larger money center banks who will face more stiff competition from regional banks, emboldened by the Fed support, as they can now act more aggressively to gain and retain clients or deposits.""
JON SAKODA, FOUNDER OF EARLY-STAGE VENTURE FIRM DECIBEL PARTNERS, SAN FRANCISCO:
""This is a huge step in restoring confidence in the startup community. Before this move many startups were planning emergency measures which would have likely led to more layoffs and furloughed employees. The government's actions have provided much needed certainty that everyone can make payroll on Monday.""
MICHAEL PURVES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT TALLBACKEN CAPITAL ADVISORS:
""What investors have to expect coming into tomorrow and beyond is that we are going to be dealing with a lot of event risk. There are still going to be lingering questions with other regional banks.
""Under such a such a scenario, it's hard not to expect very high-rate volatility. If that happens it's really hard to think we'll have an equity rally.""
GREG MCBRIDE, CHIEF FINANCIAL ANALYST, BANKRATE:
""While the Fed has talked about a lot in the past year, until today it has been in the context of monetary policy. But today the Fed acts in the capacity of an even more important role, the lender of last resort, to make sure banks and credit unions have access to whatever cash they need without needing to sell high-quality assets that may be trading for less than face value due to the sharp increase in interest rates.

Business,/business/finance/,Silicon Valley exhales after US intervenes in SVB collapse,Krystal Hu,2023-03-13 04:47:00+00:00,,"March 12 (Reuters) - A wave of relief swept over Silicon Valley Sunday following a tense weekend of board meetings, emergency funding plans and pleas for help after regulators stepped in to backstop the region’s embattled namesake bank.
Banking regulators said Sunday evening that depositors at Silicon Valley Bank, which was shuttered Friday, would have access to their funds Monday, putting to rest fears that startups would struggle to pay their employees this week. The bank's closure had followed interest rate hikes that hurt its startup customers and a failed capital raise attempt, spurring deposit withdrawals.
Despite the palpable relief, questions still remained about the funding environment for startups, which had come to rely on Silicon Valley Bank for support to back unproven businesses that larger banks eschew. And the bank still had not found a buyer as of Sunday, which was a hope of many venture capital firms and tech founders hungry for positive news.
“This is a huge step in restoring confidence in the startup community. Before this move many startups were planning emergency measures which would have likely led to more layoffs and furloughed employees. The actions have provided much needed certainty that everyone can make payroll on Monday,” said Jon Sakoda, founder of early stage venture firm Decibel Partners.

The bank's sudden shutdown sent a chill through Silicon Valley amid an otherwise gloomy period marked by tech layoffs and a pullback in spending as consumers tightened their wallets. Company executives, many of whom stashed all of their funds in Silicon Valley Bank, took to Twitter and other social media networks to beg for relief.
Sam Altman, who heads OpenAI, known for its ChatGPT artificial intelligence software, was among those who answered the call, offering emergency funding to startups to help weather the uncertainty and pay their employees, Reuters reported Sunday.
Tech investor Asheesh Birla had spent the last three days working nonstop, between advising companies about how to make payroll, or urging people to call their local politician. He is very happy with the federal government’s decision to backstop deposits but not make the bank’s equity holders whole, he said.
“Companies should never have to worry about whether or not their deposits are safe,” he said.
A joint statement Sunday by U.S. government bodies including the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve indicated taxpayers would not bear any cost associated with the new plans around Silicon Valley Bank. However, shareholders and some unsecured creditors won’t receive the same protections.
Birla predicts that in the next few days, startups will rush en masse to open accounts at large banks. And for companies that hold considerable cash positions, he thinks that there will be a surge of interest in hiring treasurers who will work to minimize the amount of cash companies are holding at any moment.
Silicon Valley Bank until now had been a reliable source of funding for startups relative to other banks.
Doktor Gurson, CEO of Rad AI, said the news represented a “collective sigh of relief” after days worrying about how to make payroll for his startup with some 65 employees. “I lost a couple years of my life over the weekend to be honest. It’s been a bit of a roller coaster.”
Still, the saga is far from over. Even as Rad AI plans to move money to new accounts in bigger banks, exactly when it can access all its SVB funds remains unclear, he said.
“I don’t know that there’s any safe place to go,” he said. “I’m still a little bit nervous of what could happen.""
He added, ""We’ll still need to assess what we’re doing moving forward.”

Business,/business/finance/,India tech minister plans to meet startups on SVB fallout,Reuters,2023-03-12 16:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/GRCYHUOQRRPYHJJVZE2KE6FV3M.jpg,"MUMBAI, March 12 (Reuters) - India's state minister for technology said on Sunday he will meet start-ups this week to assess the impact on them of Silicon Valley Bank's (SIVB.O) collapse, as concerns rise about the fallout for the Indian start-up sector.
California banking regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) on Friday after a run on the lender, which had $209 billion in assets at the end of 2022, with depositors pulling out as much as $42 billion on a single day, rendering it insolvent.
""Start-ups are an important part of the new India economy. I will meet with Indian Startups this week to understand impact on them and how the government can help during the crisis,"" Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the state minister for IT said on Twitter.
India has one of the world's biggest start-up markets, with many clocking multi-billion-dollar valuations in recent years and getting the backing of foreign investors, who have made bold bets on digital and other tech businesses.

SVB's failure, the biggest in the U.S. since the 2008 financial crisis, has roiled global markets, hit banking stocks and is now unsettling Indian entrepreneurs.
Two partners at an Indian venture capital fund and one lender to Indian start-ups told Reuters that they are running checks with portfolio companies on any SVB exposure and if so, whether it is a significant part of their total bank balance.
Consumer internet startups, which have drawn the bulk of funding in India in recent years, are less affected because they either do not have an SVB account or have minimal exposure to it, the three people said.
""Spoke to some founders and it is very bad,"" Ashish Dave, CEO of Mirae Asset Venture Investments (India), wrote in a tweet.
""Especially for Indian founders ... who setup their U.S. companies and raised their initial round, SVB is default bank. Uncertainty is killing them. Growth ones are relatively safer as they diversified. Last thing founders needed.""
Software firm Freshworks (FRSH.O) said it has minimal exposure to the SVB situation relative to the company's overall balance sheet.
""As we grew, we brought on larger, diversified banks such as Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and UBS. The vast majority of our cash and marketable securities today is not held at SVB,"" Freshworks said in a blog post, adding that the company does not foresee any disruption to employees or customers.
Freshworks said it is working with customers and vendors who were using its SVB account to migrate to alternate bank accounts.
India's Nazara Technologies Ltd (NAZA.NS), a mobile gaming company, said in a stock exchange filing that two of its subsidiaries, Kiddopia Inc and Mediawrkz Inc, hold cash balances totalling $7.75 million or 640 million rupees with SVB.

Business,/business/aerospace-defense/,Germany's Fraport says higher costs to dent 2023 earnings,Anna Mackenzie,2023-03-14 12:26:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NGMPYTZL6FLAJOL7HWT5KZGN5U.jpg,"FRANKFURT, March 14 (Reuters) - Frankfurt Airport operator Fraport (FRAG.DE) on Tuesday forecast 2023 earnings below market expectations, sending its shares down by as much as 7%, as higher operational costs erode gains from increased traffic.
Air traffic at airports across Germany has been disrupted by ongoing strikes over pay and conditions, after the rapid recovery in tourism in 2022 led to staff shortages and soaring inflation prompted employees to demand higher wages.
Chief Executive Stefan Schulte said expected wage increases were a major factor in rising costs, meaning that the outcome of ongoing negotiations would impact whether Fraport's ground handling business could break even next year as hoped.
The operator of Germany's largest airport sees annual earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 1.04 billion to 1.20 billion euros ($1.11 billion to 1.29 billion) in 2023. The outlook mid-point of 1.12 billion euros was below an analysts' estimate of 1.17 billion euros in Refinitiv data.
View 2 more stories 
Jefferies analyst Graham Hunt said the guidance reflected cost inflation that was expected to offset faster traffic recovery this year. He said staff costs were the main reason for what he called a cautious outlook.
Fraport expects 2023 passenger traffic to be between 80% and 90% of the pre-pandemic level of 2019.
The group in January said passenger travel at its airports nearly doubled last year, driven by the relaxation of travel restrictions after pandemic-related lockdowns, but was still around 30% below the 2019 level.
In response to the rebound in traffic, it has expanded its operational workforce at Frankfurt Airport and plans to hire some 1,500 staff members this year, it said.
But the company is also struggling to fill open positions, with Schulte saying that a planned government reform of immigration law did not go far enough to bring in foreign workers over the the long term.
Fraport's 2022 EBITDA rose by 36% to 1.03 billion euros from a year earlier and was around 13% below the 2019 figure of 1.18 billion euros.
Fraport, which last paid a dividend for fiscal 2018, said it would also not propose a dividend for 2022, citing the continued economic impact of the pandemic.
Its shares were down 1.7% at 1214 GMT, at the bottom of Germany's mid-cap index (.MDAXI).

For months, airlines had been bullish on travel demand, which had allowed them to lift fares even as consumers cut down on discretionary spending due to rising inflation.
But United on Monday cited ""new seasonal demand patterns"" during January and February, when travel appetite generally tends to cool, put pressure on its pricing power as it also operated more flights in anticipation of continued demand.
Though United expects second-quarter revenue to be better than expectations and reiterated its full-year profit forecast, J.P. Morgan analysts said investors were still likely to be spooked by the current-quarter guide.
BofA Global Research analysts said a likely widening gap between booking and travel dates could also further pressure ticket prices.
Total revenue per available seat mile, a proxy for pricing power, is estimated to be up 22% to 23% in the first quarter from a year earlier, slower than the 25% growth expected previously, United said.
View 2 more stories 
United forecast an adjusted diluted loss per share of between $0.60 and $1.00 in the first quarter, also due to higher fuel costs and expenses related to a new contract it is negotiating with pilots, which the airline is recognizing a quarter early.
However, the new demand patterns are expected to lift the second quarter, which consist of peak travel months. Operating revenue is now expected to be up in the mid-teens range compared to last year.
""The company is seeing stronger revenue in the peak months and more discounting in off-peak months,"" TD Cowen analyst Helane Becker wrote in a note.
Meanwhile, United's rival Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) on Tuesday reaffirmed its first-quarter outlook.

Business,/business/finance/,Signature Bank becomes next casualty of banking turmoil after SVB,Hannah Lang,2023-03-13 12:19:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/V4ZX2PLB6ZMM7KQ5SESUDRNOMU.jpg,"March 12 (Reuters) - State regulators closed New York-based Signature Bank (SBNY.O) on Sunday, the third largest failure in U.S. banking history, two days after authorities shuttered Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) in a collapse that stranded billions in deposits.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took control of Signature, which had $110.36 billion in assets and $88.59 billion in deposits at the end of last year, according to New York state's Department of Financial Services.
All of the depositors of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank will be made whole, and ""no losses will be borne by the taxpayer,"" the U.S. Treasury Department and other bank regulators said in a joint statement.
Employees appeared to gather at the company's Manhattan headquarters for meetings on Sunday, ordering catering from Carmine's, an Italian restaurant, and Starbucks coffee, according to a Reuters reporter on the scene. People trickled out of the building after the news of the closure was announced.

Representatives for the lender did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Signature's failure followed Silicon Valley Bank's Friday shutdown, the second largest in U.S. history behind Washington Mutual, which collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.
Investors were unnerved by the speed at which startup-focused SVB, the 16th largest lender in the U.S., was toppled by customer withdrawals. The episode last week erased more than $100 billion in market value from U.S. banks, prompting swift action from government officials over the weekend to try and restore confidence in the financial system.
The FDIC established a ""bridge"" successor bank on Sunday which will enable customers to access their funds on Monday. Signature Bank's depositors and borrowers will automatically become customers of the bridge bank, the FDIC said.
The regulator named former Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) Chief Executive Greg Carmichael as CEO of the bridge bank.
Silicon Valley Bank customers will have access to their deposits starting on Monday, U.S. officials said on Sunday. The federal government also announced actions to shore up deposits and try and stem any broader fallout.
Signature was a commercial bank with private client offices in New York, Connecticut, California, Nevada and North Carolina, and had nine national business lines including commercial real estate and digital asset banking.
As of September, almost a quarter of its deposits came from the cryptocurrency sector, but the bank announced in December that it would shrink its crypto-related deposits by $8 billion.
Signature Bank announced in February that its chief executive officer, Joseph DePaolo, would transition into a senior adviser role in 2023 and would be succeeded by the bank’s chief operating officer, Eric Howell. DePaolo has served as president and CEO since Signature's inception in 2001.
The bank had a long-standing relationship with former President Donald Trump and his family, providing Trump and his business with checking accounts and financing several of the family's ventures. Signature Bank cut ties with Trump in 2021 following the deadly Jan. 6 riots on Capitol Hill, and urged Trump to resign.
In a statement, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she hoped the U.S. government's actions on Sunday would provide ""increased confidence in the stability of our banking system.""
""Many depositors at these banks are small businesses, including those driving the innovation economy, and their success is key to New York's robust economy,"" she said.
Officials said on Sunday shareholders and certain unsecured debtholders of Signature Bank, as well as those of Silicon Valley Bank, would not be protected, and that senior management of both banks has been removed.
Any losses to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund used to support uninsured depositors will be recovered by a special assessment on banks, as required by law, officials said.

Business,/business/stock-pickers-reckon-its-time-move-central-banks-2023-03-06/,Stock pickers reckon it's time to move on from central banks,Naomi Rovnick,2023-03-06 14:51:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YNQFD6LKABO3XGE2NGNYUIV754.jpg,"LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Stock market investors are calling time on the idea that the Federal Reserve, and other major central banks, have their back.
Hopes for interest rate cuts by year-end have evaporated, given resilient data and sticky inflation, suggesting central banks will instead be inclined to keep borrowing costs around their highest since 2007 for some time.
The take away for money managers? Switch from so-called growth stocks, such as tech, and focus on businesses that can withstand the end of cheap funding -- banks that benefit from higher rates and resources and consumer staples businesses that can sell goods at prices that match inflation.
Companies that pay high dividends relative to their share prices, instead of investing in growth, are also favoured.
""For years, we've had a capitalist world that was highly dependent on central-banking policy and the 'Fed put',"" said Gerry Fowler, head of European equity strategy at UBS, referring to the concept of central banks supporting financial markets any time economies turn lower.
""We are rapidly transitioning away from that.""

European banking stocks (.SX7E), considered a deep value investment because of relatively low price-to-earnings ratios and higher dividend yields, have jumped 24% this year.
Global equity income funds had their first annual net inflows last year since 2014, according to Morningstar data, a trend that has continued into 2023.
Shares in tech firms, which dominate world equity markets and rely on cheap money to fund innovation, had a strong start to 2023 on hopes that aggressive rate hikes would soon end as the economic cycle decelerated.
The Nasdaq (.IXIC) is still up about 12% year-to-date and a sub-index of European tech stocks has gained 15% (.SX8P). Still, these rallies lost steam from February with a build-up of strong U.S. jobs and consumer data and as euro zone inflation stayed high.
With policymakers prioritising the inflation fight and money markets pricing U.S. rates moving above 5% this year, the door on rate cuts soon has been shut.
""We probably are not getting a (central bank) pivot,"" said Janus Henderson portfolio manager Robert Schramm-Fuchs. He added that he was buying shares in companies in mature industries left behind by the easy money-enforced tech bubble, such as miners and industrial suppliers.
""We're going back to what investing used to be,"" he said. ""It is a good environment for stock-picking.""
Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at UK asset manager Premier Miton, said his funds were adding to positions in energy companies and banks, among the clear winners of the last six months.
It's a contrast to recent years. In 2020 for instance, cheap money flooded into tech and other growth stocks, with rapid growth rates forecast far into the future, as interest rates were slashed to safeguard economies from pandemic-related shutdowns.
The Nasdaq soared 44% in 2020, its biggest annual surge since 2009.
Exuberant market conditions and risk taking are being replaced by the more sober activity of scanning for undervalued firms that pay decent dividends.
A Reuters poll of 300 global asset managers last month showed 70% of those surveyed believed these so-called value stocks would outperform this year.
BlackRock Investment Institute, the research arm of the world's biggest asset manager, is also tipping value shares.
MSCI's value index , containing stocks with low price-to-book value and high dividend yields, has significantly underperformed its tech stock-dominated growth index since early 2020.
This value index is dominated by energy companies viewed as benefiting from China's economic reopening, banks that profit from higher rates and health care and household products businesses that could pass cost inflation on to the consumers of these basic goods.
In Europe, recent data showed company profit margins have been increasing alongside input costs.
""With the reopening of China and the stabilisation of the economy in Europe, that's enough for these kinds of stocks to work,"" Janus' Schramm-Fuchs said.
Another sign investors are turning towards value shares is the reduced premium they are paying for growth stocks.
The gap between the price-earnings multiple on MSCI's growth index (.dMIWO0000GNUS), dominated by Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), and its value counterpart was its highest in a decade in December 2020. It has returned to pre-pandemic levels but remains elevated compared to the end of the Fed's last rate-rise cycle in early 2019.
""This convergence (between growth and value) should continue to be your base case,"" said Ryan Reardon, ETF strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""Central banks will keep rates high.""

Business,/business/retail-consumer/,U.S. CFPB's bid to curb late credit card fees faces strong opposition,Niket Nishant,2023-03-06 16:01:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IIFZQHQYEFLRTHO26WHAOPPXEA.jpg,"March 06 (Reuters) - A U.S. consumer watchdog's proposal to slash late fees on credit cards is facing a rough road ahead as lenders gear up for what could turn out to be a fierce battle with the agency, industry experts and analysts said.
Last month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it was looking to curb such ""excessive"" fees, which cost American consumers about $12 billion each year, according to the agency's estimates.
Credit card issuers that have a bigger exposure to subprime customers or private label cards, which can only be used with a specific brand, could be the worst hit, with revenues expected to decline by mid-to-high single-digit percentage points, ratings agency Fitch estimates.
Fitch identified Discover Financial Services (DFS.N), Capital One Financial (COF.N), Synchrony Financial (SYF.N) and Bread Financial Holdings (BFH.N) among those at risk.

The American Bankers Association (ABA), which represents Wall Street banks as well as regional lenders, has already warned that the CFPB's proposal ""flagrantly violates federal law"", according to a statement shared with Reuters.
""If the proposal is enacted, credit card issuers will be forced to adjust to the new risks by reducing credit lines, tightening standards for new accounts and raising APRs (annual percentage rates) for all consumers, including the millions who pay on time,"" ABA president and Chief Executive Officer Rob Nichols said.
Credit card companies typically rely on late fees to act as a bulwark against spending volumes tapering off when the economic environment is tough.
If the CFPB's rule is implemented in its current form, it could reduce those fees by as much as 75% annually, the agency said.
""It disregards administrative law,"" advocacy group The Bank Policy Institute said, adding the CFPB had not provided a ""reasonable basis"" for the move.
Analysts also expect a tough pushback from the industry. Michael Taiano, senior analyst at Fitch Ratings, said card companies could potentially resort to legal action to delay enforcement of these rules.
""They could also respond by introducing other fees, like statement charges, which would charge a customer every time they request a statement,"" Taiano said.
CFPB will seek pubic comments on the proposed rule until April 3, it has said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's five members are due to vote March 15 on issuing three new proposals, according to the agency's website. Since last year, the commission has unveiled a series of cybersecurity proposals citing increased danger to public companies and investors.
The Commission will vote on whether to propose requiring broker-dealers, clearing houses and others to address the risk of hacking by adopting internal policies, alerting the commission to incidents and publicly disclosing them.
A similar proposal released last year applied to investment advisers and drew objections from some industry groups, who said requiring investment firms to report hacking incidents confidentially within 48 hours could hinder efforts to fix the problem quickly.

Markets,/markets/global-markets-wrapup-1-pix-2023-03-14/,Shares fall as market stress stokes volatility,Amanda Cooper,2023-03-14 11:37:00+00:00,,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Global shares fell for a sixth day on Tuesday as a brewing U.S. banking crisis prompted investors to downgrade their expectations for interest rate hikes, even ahead of key inflation data later in the day.
As recently as a week ago, investors were just recovering from a reality-check that prompted many to assume that rates around the world were likely to head much higher and stay there for longer than previously expected.
In under a week, three U.S. banks have collapsed. It has been the failure of technology-sector lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) that has rattled investor confidence and triggered a rush into safe-haven assets like bonds and gold.
Banking stocks around the world have shed hundreds of billions of dollars in value in a matter of days, while the government bond market has seen one of its biggest rallies in decades.

The MSCI All-World index (.MIWD00000PUS) was down 0.4%, falling for a sixth day in a row, largely due to steep declines across Asian equity markets, while in Europe shares (.STOXX) snapped a two-day rout and rose 0.4%.
Short-dated U.S. Treasury yields rose 19 basis points to around 4.22%, but given that on Monday they posted their largest one-day drop since 1987, the rise on Tuesday still left yields at their lowest in six months.
Many have drawn parallels to the 2008 financial crisis, when indicators of financial market stress shot up and equities crumbled. But Societe Generale chief currency strategist Kit Juckes said the current situation was far more like the U.S. savings and loans crisis of the 1980s, in which hundreds of smaller banks folded when the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates to control inflation.
SVB, which was the 16th biggest U.S. bank at the end of last year, is the largest lender to fail since 2008. Specifics of the tech-focused bank's abrupt collapse are still something of a jumble, but the sharp rise in Fed rates in the last year, which tightened financial conditions in the startup space in which it was a notable player, seemed front and centre.
""I don't think this is a systemic global banking issue. If it's an issue, it's an issue of a smaller but less-regulated bank that has been growing very fast on the back of being less regulated in a stable environment that has turned nasty,"" Juckes said.
""When I look at (the savings and loans crisis), we had a very mild recession, even though we were worried about it at the time. We had a very big interest rate reduction after a very big interest rate increase,"" he said. ""(SVB) seems very unlikely to have very big systemic implications, particularly when U.S. authorities have come in so quickly to start tackling it.""
Overnight the VIX (.VIX) volatility index, nicknamed Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", neared six-month highs and other indicators of market stress showed early signs of strain. An index of bond market volatility - the ICE BofA MOVE index (.MOVE) - had hit a 14-year high by Monday's close.
The S&P banking index fell 7% on Monday, its largest one-day drop since June 2020. Shares in non-U.S. lenders have come under intense pressure and a number of indicators of banking sector credit risk are showing signs of stress.
""Interbank markets have become stressed,"" said Damien Boey, chief equity strategist at Sydney-based investment bank Barrenjoey.
""Arguably, liquidity measures should have stopped these dynamics, but Main Street has been watching news and queues – not financial plumbing,"" he said.
Yields on government bonds from the U.S. to Germany and Japan have dived in the last week. German two-year yields, which fell by the most at least since reunification in 1990, while Japanese yields have fallen by the most in decades.
Elsewhere, the dramatic re-pricing of U.S. rate expectations has knocked 1.5% off the value of the U.S. dollar in the last week, which in turn has helped encourage a push into gold , a traditional safe haven that has gained 5% in the last week alone to trade around $1,900 an ounce.
The dollar gained some respite on Tuesday and was last up 0.6% against the yen at 134.03 yen and up 0.1% against the euro at $1.0716.
Data at 1230 GMT on U.S. consumer inflation had been a set piece for markets prior to the failure of SVB, but given the volatility, Tuesday's figures may have little impact on expectations for the Fed's meeting next week.
""I always thought that with inflation where it was, that central banks would keep hiking until they broke something, which was especially likely with the yield curve so inverted. Now they have broken something, is that enough for a pause? Much will depend on whether markets and contagion risk can calm quickly enough,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said.
Oil prices slid nearly 2% to below $80 a barrel .

Approximately 0.5% of Etsy's active sellers -or around 2,700 merchants- had their payments delayed on Friday related to SVB's collapse, according to Etsy.
""We are working to pay these sellers today, and we’ve already started processing payments via another payment partner this morning,"" an Etsy spokesperson told Reuters on Monday.
The payments Etsy sellers received is unrelated to the Federal Reserve's Sunday announcement, which ensured that SVB's customers would have access to their funds on Monday.
Shopify (SHOP.TO), which provides websites and apps to stores, also halted payments to online sellers with Silicon Valley Bank accounts, telling merchants they must switch accounts to receive funds, according to the company's website.

Etsy and Shopify each work with 5.4 million and 1.75 million online merchants respectively worldwide, mostly small-to-medium size businesses.
Some Etsy sellers decided to put their stores on vacation mode, pausing customer purchases in an effort to minimize their financial losses while others say they have received their payments on schedule.
Moshe Steinberg, 31, said that he received a payment from Etsy on Monday morning, but is still waiting for it to clear with his bank.
""It was a nail biting situation until I checked my bank account this morning,"" the 3D-printed seller from Central Ohio said, adding that Etsy is currently his only source of income.
Etsy merchant Elizabeth Thompson, 57, said she has received little guidance from the company on what transpired.
""I just don’t understand why they can’t be a little more transparent about what’s going on. It’s not like it’s their fault,"" she added.
Etsy said it communicated with any seller who was impacted on Friday directly via email and posted an update in their forums on Saturday.
Shopify Chief Executive Tobi Lutke said in a tweet on Saturday that the company was seeing ""very minor impact"" from the SVB collapse.
""We use SVB as one of 12 or so banks spread over mostly Canada and US,"" Lutke said, adding ""a small portion of our US operational fund flows is tied up in SVB but we are working around it and it should be business as usual.""
Shopify has temporarily paused payments to its merchants who receive payments to SVB accounts. These online sellers must update their bank accounts that have no connections with SVB to resume getting payments.
Shopify Capital, an arm of Shopify that provides loans and cash advances to its merchants, has been impacted by SVB's closure, according to the company's website. Merchants are not able to view their loan offers or see their loan repayments as of now.
""Shopify expects to resume all operations for Shopify Capital in the United States within the next few days,"" the company said on its website.
Shopify is also opening interest-free balance accounts for merchants with the funds equal to the amount of payroll so that merchants can pay their employees, according to a Shopify spokesperson.
Block Inc's (SQ.N) Square, which processes credit-card payments for online and brick-and-mortar businesses, on Friday began pausing payments to their merchants SVB accounts and required them to update their banking information, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Switching bank accounts can pose a problem for sellers whose sole business account was with SVB. The payment holds have forced thousands of marketplace sellers and mom-and-pop shops to scramble to switch bank accounts and scurry to get access to funds for new product inventory.

The explosion of banking stress has reshaped the entire U.S. interest rate map, wiping expectations of further Federal Reserve rate hikes off the table and sending U.S. Treasury bond volatility to its highest since 2009.
The release of February's U.S. consumer price inflation report later on Tuesday had until a few days ago promised to be the biggest market mover of the week - but now it may prove to be something of a sideshow to a wider unfolding drama.
Despite weekend moves by the Fed and other regulators to protect depositors at the failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, and Monday's assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden that savings in the wider system were safe, bank stocks continued to fall in the United States and around the world.
Major U.S. banks lost around $90 billion in stock market value on Monday, bringing their loss over the past three trading sessions to nearly $190 billion. Regional U.S. banks were hit the hardest, with shares of First Republic Bank (FRC.N) diving more than 60% as news of new financing failed to calm investors and credit rating firm Moody's reviewed it for a downgrade.

Banking stocks in Asia extended declines on Tuesday, with Japanese firms hit particularly hard. After falling almost 6% on Monday, including a 13% drop in Germany's Commerzbank (CBKG.DE) and a near 10% fall in Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Europe's main banking index (.SX7P) was down another 1% again on Tuesday too.
But the implications of this sudden bout of financial instability - and its potential economic and policy fallout - were most clearly seen in the interest rate and bond markets.
The extraordinary volte-face has futures markets doubt whether the Fed will raise rates at all next week - pricing less than a 50% chance of a quarter point hike compared to the half-point rate rise that was fully priced only a week ago.
More striking is the fact that those same markets now suspect the whole Fed tightening cycle may be over, pricing peak rates at just 4.71% - below the upper band of the current target range of 4.50-4.75% and almost a percentage point below 'terminal rate' assumptions only last week.
What's more, futures also price almost a full percentage point of rate cuts between now and the end of the year. Implied terminal rates for the European Central Bank and Bank of England have been dramatically scaled back too - though one or two further hikes are still priced for those central banks.
Although it's regained some ground today, the dollar has weakened against the euro, pound and yen this week.
But the Fed rethink has led to seismic action on the U.S. Treasury market, with the biggest drop in 2-year Treasury yields on Monday since the stock market crash of 1987.
At a trough of 3.83% early on Tuesday, those 2-year yields hit their lowest since September last year before rebounding to just back above 4%. As 10-year yields nudged back above 3.5%, a re-steepening of the deeply inverted 2-10 year yield curve - for many a culprit in the onset of banking troubles - stalled.
The scale of the bond gyrations was captured in a surge in the MOVE index (.MOVE) of implied Treasury market volatility to its highest since 2009 - exceeding the most stressful periods around the 2020 pandemic and the 2018 repo market shock.
Credit spreads in the corporate bond markets have also widened sharply as investors fear an economy-wide tightening of borrowing standards and financial conditions. Indices of U.S. high-yield 'junk' bonds fell to their lowest for the year.
To the extent that this shock to the system hits business borrowing, confidence and hiring plans, the Fed will likely want some time to assess the fallout at least. It would certainly think twice about tightening policy again into this level of financial stress and bond market upheaval.
Recriminations among oversight agencies as to why SVB's problems were not spotting well in advance are likely to mount - with the Fed's remit for maintaining financial stability likely clashing with its low inflation and full employment mandates.
The Fed said late Monday it would be conducting a review of the supervision and regulation of SVB, and Chairman Jerome Powell demanded a ""thorough, transparent, and swift review"" by Vice Chairman for Supervision Michael Barr by May 1.
In one of the first public appearances by a Fed policymaker since the crisis, Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman is scheduled to speak later on Tuesday.
The February consumer price report due before then - much like last week's employment numbers - may already be out of date as a temperature gauge of the economy going forward.
Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday:
* US Feb Consumer Price Index, NFIB Feb small business survey, Cleveland Fed Feb CPI
* US Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman speaks
* ECOFIN of European Union finance ministers meets in Brussels

Markets,/markets/rates-bonds/,Analysis: Door slams on Japan bank rally as focus turns to bond holdings in wake of SVB,Tom Westbrook,2023-03-14 09:41:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2CY32A5BN5MNHI26TFXBQGBVLY.jpg,"SINGAPORE, March 14 (Reuters) - Tokyo banking stocks stood within sight of decade highs last week, testing the top of a range that has bound them since the 2008 global financial crisis -- then Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, dashing hopes of a new dawn for banking in Japan.
Losses in Silicon Valley Bank's bond portfolio have highlighted similar risks for Japanese lenders' gigantic foreign bond holdings, which are carrying over 4 trillion yen ($30 billion) in unrealised losses.
At the same time, a radical shift in the global interest rate outlook has dashed bets on policy normalisation - and more lucrative lending - any time soon in Japan.
Three days of selling has the Tokyo Stock Exchange banks index (.IBNKS.T) down 16% - its sharpest drop since the days after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami struck Japan. The index led falls in Asia on Tuesday while other markets steadied.

""Japanese banks share with SVB the characteristic of having substantial holdings of bonds, whose prices fall when bond yields rise, creating solvency risk,"" said Michael Makdad, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar in Tokyo.
Most, he said, have hedged their exposure and stand prepared to manage losses. Japan's banks have also said as much.
But sharp falls in the shares of Japan Post Bank (7182.T), which Makdad calculated as the most exposed, and some slight wobbles in bond prices for the unlisted Norinchukin - also with heavy exposure - illustrate concern and Japan's vulnerability.
Japan's bondholdings are also huge. Japanese investors are the largest foreign owners of U.S. Treasuries, with financial firms chief among big holders since low domestic loan rates and low yields drive them to find better, but safe, returns elsewhere.
""The difference comes from the loan-to-deposit ratio,"" said Norihiro Yamaguchi, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
""In Japan, it's quite low compared to other banks in the Asian region, so it means that they rely heavily on bond investments,"" he said. ""With the chronic low interest rate environment in Japan, they actively invest in U.S. Treasuries.""
Most of the time, bond losses aren't a problem for banks, which typically hold their investments to maturity.
But after the worst year in global bond markets for decades, the losses are very big -- foreign bond losses totalled about 3 trillion at the end of December at Japan's top three banks, and analysts at SMBC Nikko calculated another 1.4 trillion yen in unrealised foreign bond losses for regional banks.
Most analysts agree these risks are in hand. An annual Bank of Japan report published on Tuesday said Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital buffers.
But it also said portfolio losses have swelled at regional banks, and that is where selling pressure has been heaviest as investors fret that smaller lenders will find it harder to navigate market volatility.
Share prices for such lenders had rallied hardest through the autumn as speculation mounted that a shift out of ultra-easy policy settings in Japan was in the offing and the prospect of higher interest rates and better margins lay ahead.
Japan's top regional bank, Resona Holdings (8308.T), was the biggest loser on the Nikkei on Tuesday, dropping 9.2%, and is now falling harder than peers with a 21% loss in three days.
Japan's biggest financial firm, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306.T) fell 8.6% on Tuesday and has lost more than 2 trillion yen in market value with a 17% drop in three sessions.
""I think it's about bonds getting hit,"" said Joshua Crabb, head of Asia-Pacific equities at Robeco. ""And maybe some concerns Japanese banks have exposures, and some profit taking,"" he said. The banking index rose 40% from September to February.

With inflationary pressures still evident amid strong business conditions, and a robust labour data expected later in the week, domestic factors will be the key focus for the Reserve Bank of Australia ahead of its meeting on April 4, even as it continues to assess the fallout from SVB's collapse.
Analysts at three of the top four lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX), National Australia Bank (NAB.AX), and ANZ Group Holdings (ANZ.AX) - continue to expect the RBA to deliver its 11th consecutive rate hike next month. 0#RBAWATCH
""The Australian domestic fundamentals remain consistent with further tightening from the RBA,"" Adelaide Timbrell, senior economist at ANZ Research said.
Analysts at the top three banks expect a quarter-point hike in April, taking the cash rate to 3.85%, with two of the banks forecasting it to peak at 4.10% in May.
View 2 more stories 
Since May last year, the RBA has increased interest rates by 350 bps, fairly in lockstep with the U.S. Federal Reserve, resulting in one of the most aggressive policy tightening cycle in decades.
However, developments of the past few days could increase the risk that global central banks may pause sooner than expected, Timbrell suggested, as investors increasingly bet the Fed would be reluctant to hike rates next week.
Australian banking sector, while not immune to the collapse of SVB, is in a ""more insulated"" position, Rodrigo Catril, senior FX strategist at NAB said.
""We are kind of watching this from a distance and we are benefiting from that distance as well,"" Catril said.
Australian banks are some of the most well-capitalised in the world, with regulatory structures in place ensuring an ""unquestionably strong"" capital framework, proper governance, resilience to rising interest rates, and higher lending standards.
Globally, banking stocks have taken a hit from the collapse of SVB despite of assurances from U.S. authorities, prompting a reassessment of interest rate expectations.
CBA Chief Economist Stephen Halmarick, however, expects quarter-point rate hikes in March and May from the Fed, citing inflation in the U.S. ""remains too high for the Fed"". FEDWATCH

""We will follow the agreement strictly,"" the official, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Russia's TASS news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko as saying the deal, which helps Ukraine export agricultural products following Russia's invasion, had been extended on the previous conditions.
Grushko said the deal had been extended for 60 days. A Russian source said separately earlier on Tuesday that the 60-day extension meant that after 60 days one of the parties may raise the issue of the deal's termination.
Ukraine, however, indicated that the July agreement clearly states that extensions are possible for a minimum of 120 days and the original agreement should be amended if parties want a shorten terms.

""The Russians realised that 60 days (extension) is not legally possible, so they are trying to find a way out,"" the senior Ukrainian government official said.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative was brokered by the United Nations and Turkey last July and was extended in November.
Kyiv said it wanted to extend the deal by at least one year and that Ukraine wanted the city of Mykolaiv's ports included.
Since Russia and Ukraine signed the deal in Turkey last July, millions of tonnes of grain and other food products have been exported from Ukrainian ports.

An indicator of credit risk in the euro zone banking system leapt to its highest since mid-July, as worries about contagion risks from the collapse of two U.S. banks compounded investor concerns about the impact on lenders of rising interest rates.
The VIX (.VIX) volatility index, Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", neared six-month highs overnight, although futures pointed to a modestly higher Wall St open on Tuesday, with U.S. regional banks bouncing in pre-market trading after recent brutal losses.
Banking giants Citi (C.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and JP Morgan (JPM.N) were also 1%-3% higher in the pre-market.
Europe's banking index (.SX7P) fell 0.6% after posting its biggest percentage loss in more than a year on Monday, although some said banks in the region were less vulnerable.

""A critical difference between the European and U.S. systems, which will limit the impact across the Atlantic, is that European banks' bond holdings are lower and their deposits more stable,"" credit rating agency Moody's said in a note.
Still, shares of embattled Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) fell 4.5% after it said customer ""outflows stabilized to much lower levels but had not yet reversed"" in its 2022 annual report.
And Britain's HSBC (HSBA.L), which bought SVB's UK arm on Monday, rescuing a key lender for British technology start-ups, slipped 1.4% in its fourth consecutive day of losses.
Asian banking stocks had earlier extended their declines, with Japanese firms hit particularly hard as anxiety about systemic risk sparked a wider rout in markets.
Japanese financial institutions have sufficient capital buffers to absorb losses caused by external factors, including risks caused by SVB's collapse, the Bank of Japan said.
Biden's efforts to reassure markets and depositors came after emergency U.S. measures to shore up banks by giving them access to additional funding failed to dispel investor worries about potential contagion to other lenders worldwide.
""The dramatic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and widespread market turmoil in the subsequent days is ""part of the process"" of the world tightening financial conditions after years of cheap money,"" Morgan Stanley co-president Edward Pick said.
""This is part of the process of the knob being turned to tighten financial conditions to make sure that we are on our way to normalising a higher interest rate world,"" Pick said.
""But there might well be surprises, there might well be reactions,"" he added on Tuesday.
A furious race to reprice interest rate expectations also buffeted markets as investors bet the U.S. Federal Reserve will be reluctant to hike next week.
Traders currently see a 50% chance of no rate hike at that meeting, with rate cuts priced in for the second half of the year. Early last week, a 25 basis point hike was fully priced in, with a 70% chance seen of 50 basis points.

Short-end yields in the euro zone tumbled again as investors bet the European Central Bank would moderate its policy tightening at Thursday's meeting, with chances of a Bank of England hike next week also seen receding.
Antonio Patuelli head of the Italian Banking Association told Il Corriere della Sera he hoped that in the wake of the SVB collapse ""the ECB will do more thinking than the already announced decision to raise rates further"".
Yunosuke Ikeda, chief equity strategist at Nomura Securities, said the shift to much less aggressive Fed hike expectations has also tempered the outlook for an eventual pivot in Japan away from ultra-low interest rates.
The prospect of higher rates had been ""the reason investors have been really excited about Japan bank stocks"", Ikeda added.
Analysts say uncertainty continues to dog the financial sector, with investors extremely worried about the health of smaller global banks, the prospect of tighter regulation and a preference to protect depositors at the expense of shareholders.
A wave of customers have applied to shift their accounts to large U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) from smaller lenders after SVB's collapse last week, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.
Major U.S. banks have lost nearly $190 billion since the sell-off began, with regional lenders like First Republic Bank (FRC.N), which plunged more than 60% on Monday, hit hardest.
Biden said on Monday that emergency measures taken by his administration meant Americans would be confident the U.S. banking system is ""safe"", while also promising stiffer regulation after the biggest U.S. bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis.
In a letter to clients, SVB's new CEO Tim Mayopoulos said it was open and conducting business as usual within the United States and expected to resume cross-border transactions in coming days.
""I recognize the past few days have been an extremely challenging time for our clients and our employees,"" said Mayopoulos, a former CEO of federal mortgage finance firm Fannie Mae who was appointed by the FDIC to run SVB.
U.S. bank regulators sought to reassure nervous customers who lined up outside SVB's Santa Clara, California, headquarters on Monday, offering coffee and donuts.
""Feel free to transact business as usual. We just ask for a little bit of time because of the volume,"" FDIC employee Luis Mayorga told waiting customers.
Regulators also moved swiftly to close New York's Signature Bank SBNY.O, which had come under pressure in recent days, while Canada's banking regulator took steps to begin daily check-ins with banks that will enable it to monitor their liquidity, The Globe and Mail reported on Monday.

While the global effects of Silicon Valley Bank's collapse are just emerging, one thing is clear: tech startups, no matter how far apart, are intertwined. Many depend on a single mid-sized bank for their day-to-day operations.
Following the lead of California colleagues, startups in Europe and Asia gravitated to the bank, the 16th largest in the U.S. last year, whose name rang with tech cachet and which offered them specialized financial services.

Quincy Lee, founder of Seattle-based EV charging startup Electra Era, tried to move millions of dollars from Silicon Valley Bank on Thursday afternoon as warning signs multiplied.
The website was down, overwhelmed by traffic. A customer service agent told him by phone that there could be a delay because so many people were trying to withdraw. By Monday afternoon, he had succeeded in getting his money and was looking for an alternative bank.
After a weekend of intense discussions over the future of SVB, U.S. regulators unveiled an emergency funding plan that gave the bank's customers access to all their deposits.
In the UK, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said the government and the Bank of England had facilitated a private sale of SVB's UK arm to HSBC (HSBA.L), in a move which would protect deposits without taxpayer support.
European Union officials also assured consumers the bank had a ""very limited presence"" in the bloc. And Christoph Stresing, managing director of the German Startups Association expressed cautious optimism that domestic companies would get off lightly.
European stocks fell on banking industry concerns, though, and even startups that did not bank with SVB were scrambling.
""It's hard to understand just how interconnected SVB is with the start-up ecosystem,"" said Rachael Crook, founder and CEO of London-based healthcare start-up Lifted. Over the weekend she soothed investors and made sure crucial service suppliers would not be hobbled, after executives raised concerns a key financial partner may have money tied up with SVB.
Aleksandr Volodarsky, CEO of Ukrainian startup lemon.io, which banks with SVB in the United States, told Reuters he started discussing the collapse with other entrepreneurs in the region on Thursday.
""We initiated a wire transfer on Friday morning and still nothing happened,"" he said. ""We were lucky because we just made payments to developers and engineers just two days earlier.""
SVB's Shanghai-based joint venture, SPD Silicon Valley Bank (SSVB), said it had a sound corporate structure and an independent balance sheet. SSVB is China's first technology and innovation bank, and the first Sino-U.S. joint venture bank.
As SVB was one of the few banks that made it easy for start-ups to open bank accounts for dollar financing, it was the dominant foreign bank for early-stage companies in China, advisors and companies said.
But many Chinese start-ups and fund managers are working to move their money out of SVB's U.S. arm.
One lawyer for a China-based venture capital firm said nearly all of its portfolio companies' operating cash, as well as its own operating cash was stored with SVB, and spent the weekend strategizing on alternatives.
After a rollercoaster of a weekend, Otta CEO Franklin said his company would continue banking with the UK arm of SVB and add accounts at more banks.
""The big learning curve for many of us in this industry has been, 'If you have a lot of cash, you should spread it around.'""

Markets,/markets/asia/,Exclusive: India to discourage foreign trade settlement in Chinese yuan - sources,Shivangi Acharya,2023-03-13 14:11:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/HWQREBC7Z5IJFCKDIVLQQAKKXI.jpg,"NEW DELHI, March 13 (Reuters) - India has asked banks and traders to avoid using Chinese yuan to pay for Russian imports, three government officials involved in policy making and two banking sources said, because of long-running political differences with its neighbour.
India, which has emerged as a top buyer of Russian oil as well as discounted coal, would prefer the use of United Arab Emirates dirhams to settle trade, three government officials said.
One of the government officials directly involved in the matter said New Delhi is ""not comfortable"" with foreign trade settled in yuan but said settlement in ""dirham is okay.""
The second official said that India cannot allow settlement in yuan till the relations between the two countries improve.
Thousands of Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a standoff along their disputed Himalayan border since 2021, casting a shadow over the whole relationship.

The five officials did not say whether there were also economic reasons behind India's reluctance to accept yuan settlement.
Last year India's biggest cement producer UltraTech Cement (ULTC.NS) used Chinese yuan for a cargo of Russian coal, which raised some concerns among officials as relationship between India and China has deteriorated after deadly border clashes in 2020 in the remote Galwan Valley of Ladakh.
The government reviewed the situation with officials of the central bank and bank executives, following the UltraTech deal, the second official said.
Two banking officials, aware of the matter, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not keen on foreign trade settlement in yuan, and confirmed that the government has discouraged them from using the currency.
They also said Russia was keen on yuan settlement as it helps them in purchases of goods from China.
For Indian refiners that in recent weeks started settling some Russian oil purchases in roubles, as Reuters reported, payments have been processed in part by the State Bank of India via its nostro roubles account in Russia.
But the bulk of the trade is still in other currencies as the rouble is partially convertible and the two countries are yet to finalise a framework.
All five officials declined to be named as discussions were private. India's foreign, finance ministry and RBI did not reply to requests seeking comment.
The government expected majority of payments to Russia in dirhams in the coming months, the first official said.
India has longstanding political and security ties with Russia and has refrained from condemning the Ukraine war, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"".
India is also a major buyer of Russian arms.
Indian refiners, in the meanwhile, have begun paying for most of their Russian oil bought via Dubai-based traders in dirhams instead of U.S. dollars, Reuters reported last month.
India's rupee is partially convertible, which means it has to be converted to U.S. dollars first before converting to any other currency, making it an unattractive reserve currency for global central banks and for settling trade.
It also makes Russia reluctant to accept payment in the Indian currency for its exports.

The fallout from the collapse of U.S. lenders Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O) widened overnight despite government efforts to shore up confidence, hitting bank shares globally.
Investors are cautious in the current global scenario, Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.
""There is some hope that the Fed (Federal Reserve) may not be as aggressive with the rate hikes after the SVB collapse, which could be offering support to the market,"" Khemka added.
The Nifty 50 index has lost nearly 3.5% in the last three sessions, taking losses to 5.3% thus far into the year. If the losses hold, this would be the worst quarter ending March 31 since 2020.

Meanwhile, assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden and other policymakers did little to calm markets and prompted a rethink on the Fed interest rate outlook.
Domestic banks (.NSEBANK) as well as public sector lenders (.NIFTYPSU) were among the top drags, falling 0.4% and 1.5%, respectively, even as analysts dispelled concerns saying Indian lenders were insulated from the U.S. banking crisis.
Meanwhile, India's annual retail inflation rate (INCPIY=ECI) eased to 6.44% in February from 6.52% in January but stayed above the Reserve Bank of India's targeted level for a second straight month.
Investors will now focus on the U.S. inflation data, due later in the day, for cues on the rate hike trajectory amid bets of the Fed turning less hawkish amid the banking crisis.

Markets,/markets/us/,US bank collapse sparks fresh oversight fight in divided Congress,Hannah Lang,2023-03-13 22:10:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - The weekend collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) sparked a partisan battle in Washington on Monday, with Democrats arguing that a Trump-era change to bank oversight rules undermined the stability of regional banks, claims that Republicans rejected.
Democratic President Joe Biden called on Congress and banking regulators to strengthen the rules for banks ""to make it less likely this kind of bank failure will happen again,"" while officials said customers at SVB and New York-based Signature Bank (SBNY.O), which also collapsed, would have access to all their deposits starting Monday, and announced a new facility to give banks access to emergency funds.
An administration official said there was no timeline for Biden to make any particular requests of Congress as his aides were still working to manage the immediate situation and better understand what caused the crisis and what to ask of lawmakers.
At issue are changes to the Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2018, pushed by Republicans, which raised the threshold at which banks are considered systemically risky and subject to stricter oversight to $250 billion from $50 billion. Silicon Valley Bank had $209 billion in assets at the end of last year, while Signature Bank had some $110 billion.
View 2 more stories 
""Let's be clear. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank is a direct result of an absurd 2018 bank deregulation bill signed by (Republican former President) Donald Trump that I strongly opposed,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said in a statement.
Republicans rejected the idea that the changes made during Trump's four years in the White House were to blame.
""That is absolutely not the case,"" said Bill Hagerty, Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government Ranking Member.
""What we've had, I think, in every sense is a management failure both from the standpoint of SVB's management as well as the San Francisco Fed,"" said Hagerty in an interview following a briefing by Treasury Department and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp officials to a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Monday.
Hagerty said Congress should determine who was accountable among regulators at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank and within SVB's management before considering new regulations.
""Where was the San Francisco Fed?"" he added, saying awareness of the bank's recent growth and business model should have led Fed officials to anticipate trouble.
Hagerty also said that he and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke on Sunday and agreed that markets might remain choppy for a few days. ""My hope and expectation is that as the markets digest the information that's there, the markets will calm and settle,"" the Tennessee Republican said.
Experts say SVB ultimately collapsed because it failed to manage its portfolio amid rapidly rising interest rates, and had a huge amount of uninsured deposits that were quick to leave when the stress was apparent.
In an op-ed for the New York Times, Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren placed some of the blame at the feet of bank regulators, whom she accused of ""letting financial institutions load up on risk.""
""It's clear there were big misses here,"" said Jonah Crane, a partner with Klaros Group and former Treasury Department official. ""For one, the Fed has only once ever stress tested for a high interest rate environment, despite knowing they would have to raise rates.""
Prospects for new banking legislation in a divided Congress are dim. As a result, regulators will also be in the spotlight for speedier tweaks, said Ian Katz, managing director of Capital Alpha Partners, in a note.
""There won't be legislation getting through Congress, and so regulators will be making the big decisions,"" he said.

Markets,/markets/commodities/,Column: Philippines set to go from renewable laggard to leader in SE Asia,Gavin Maguire,2023-03-14 09:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/O4MKWMLPMRN7DIUDVBL5Z5TXTU.jpg,"LITTLETON, Colorado, March 13 (Reuters) - The Philippines is set to leapfrog Vietnam as the main renewable energy producer in Southeast Asia, thanks to an aggressive project development pipeline that will result in a 15-fold boost in combined solar and wind power by 2030.
The Philippines currently ranks a distant second in the region in combined solar and wind power generation, with 1,766 megawatts (MW) of installed capacity, compared with 12,379 MW in Vietnam, data from Global Energy Monitor (GEM) shows.
By 2030, however, the Philippines will have added 17,809 MW of solar capacity and 7,856 MW of wind power to emerge as the top green power producer in Southeast Asia, one of the world's fastest-growing economic regions.
The rapid expansion in renewable energy supplies comes at a potentially critical time for the country's energy sector.
Philippine power producers relied on coal for nearly 60% of their electricity generation in 2022 and have increased coal-fired power emissions by more than 40% since 2017 to fuel the country's rapidly growing economy, which expanded by more than 7% in 2022.
View 2 more stories 
With real gross domestic product (GDP) set to expand by 5.8% in 2023, according to Goldman Sachs, and remain one of the region's fastest-growing economies over the next decade, the country has the potential to steeply increase fossil fuel emissions unless large increases in renewable power can be brought online.
A major driver behind the green power push is the looming depletion of the Malampaya gas field, which was by far the country's largest source of gas but is expected to run dry within five years.
With imports of natural gas much more expensive than domestically supplied gas, and emissions from coal-fired power generation already at record highs, the government has unveiled an array of measures designed to spur growth in renewable energy supply capacity.
A key new policy shift that was announced in late 2022 has been the removal of stipulations that require energy assets to be owned by Filipinos.
Previously, those strict ownership rules limited foreign participation in the Philippines' energy sector to a handful of oil and gas majors.
Going forward, however, the combination of new ownership rules and strong energy demand growth is expected to lure growing interest from global firms engaged in renewable energy construction, including nine Chinese firms that committed a collective $13.76 billion in investment in the sector in January.
Firms from other countries are also expected to look for opportunities in the Philippines, which has ""excellent resource potential and a strong financing environment, with public and private sector interest in renewables investment,"" according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA.)
TURNAROUND
Most of the swell in solar capacity already planned is set to emerge in 2025 and 2027, while the expansion in wind capacity is set to come nearer the end of the decade, GEM data shows.
In combination, those capacity additions should exceed any expansions in coal-fired power over the same period, and help boost clean power's share in the Philippines' electricity generation mix from 22.5% in 2022, according to data from Ember.
More clean power generation should also help the Philippines close the clean energy gap with the rest of Asia. For the whole continent, around 32% of electricity came from clean sources in 2022.
In turn, a greater proportion of power from clean sources should help the Philippines attract more manufacturing and other industries. The country is already a major producer of pharmaceuticals, electronics and semiconductors and is considered an attractive destination for firms looking to relocate operations outside of China.
Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia are all also expected to rapidly increase renewable energy supply capacity over the coming years, and may sporadically compete with the Philippines as green energy hot spots.
But the combination of aggressive government policy, an urgent drop in domestic fossil fuel supplies and projections for continued rapid energy demand growth look set to push the Philippines into the top tier of all renewable energy growth markets by 2030.

Sunrun stated SVB was one of the lenders in two of its credit facilities, but said it was less than 15% of its total hedging facilities and does not anticipate significant exposure.
Sunrun has cash deposits with SVB totaling nearly $80 million, while SVB's undrawn commitment in the non-recourse senior aggregation warehouse facility is about $40 million.
Sunnova also views its exposure to SVB as negligible since it does not hold cash deposits or securities with the financial group. However, one of its subsidiaries is part of a credit facility where SVB serves as a lender.
SVB has unfunded commitments of $15 million under the Back-Leverage Facility, which is one of three warehouse facilities currently entered into by Sunnova's subsidiaries, with a total commitment of $1.35 billion.

The sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank pressured global bank stocks further on Tuesday, following sharp losses on Monday, as investors fretted over the financial health of some lenders, despite assurances from U.S. President Joe Biden and other policymakers.
The developments have ratcheted up uncertainty about how monetary policy will now develop worldwide.
""We are following developments in the financial markets, and we currently consider there to be no risk to financial stability in Sweden,"" Thedeen said in a statement before giving testimony to parliament's finance committee.
""At the same time, it is not unusual for turbulence in foreign capital markets to spill over into Sweden. We are therefore closely monitoring the situation and, as always, we are prepared to take action in the event of a rapid change.""

It is too early to tell what effect the turbulence will have on monetary policy, he added.
""A few weeks ago, many though we would need to hike (rates) more because incoming data pointed in that direction,"" Thedeen later told reporters after giving his testimony.
""Now many believe we need to hike less. My conclusion is that it is very sensible to continue to look at the incoming data and make a decision (on monetary policy) at the end of April,"" he added.
Inflation figures for February are due on Wednesday.

Markets,/markets/europe/,Hugo Boss sees slowing sales but confident on China growth,Linda Pasquini,2023-03-09 17:18:00+00:00,,"March 9 (Reuters) - German fashion house Hugo Boss (BOSSn.DE) on Thursday forecast slower sales and earnings growth for 2023, sending its shares down as much as 4%.
The luxury group faces tougher comparison figures in 2023 after it rode the wave of a brand revamp last year. There are also market concerns that China's reopening will provide only a limited boost due the company's low exposure to the world's second biggest economy.
Hugo Boss, known for its smart men's suits, sees mid-single-digit percentage growth in annual sales and an operating profit of between 350 million and 375 million euros ($370 million and $396 million), or 5% to 12% growth.
Its 2022 sales rose 27% to 3.65 billion euros while operating earnings grew 47% to 335 million euros, as announced in January.
Cédric Rossi, analyst at Bryan Garnier, told Reuters lack of any positive surprise in the 2022 results and 2023 outlook might have triggered some profit-taking.

Rossi said investors were betting on China's reopening, which he said could appear as a weakness for Hugo Boss as China sales accounted for 6% of group sales in 2022.
Chief Executive Daniel Grieder told reporters he was ""very confident"" the company could grow in China, seeing upscale opportunities with ""lot of upside"" in China and Asia despite uncertain timing and pace of recovery.
Hugo Boss expects its Asia-Pacific sales to rise ""in the teens"" percentage range this year, against a 10% increase in 2022.
Grieder said management was convinced Hugo Boss could outperform the sector despite economic and political uncertainties in 2023.
""The first two months (of 2023) show that we can continue with the momentum,"" he said.
Hugo Boss shares, which up to Wednesday's close had gained more than 45% from their November lows, were down 1.5% at 1147 GMT.

U.S. soda and food maker PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) and Dutch dairy producer FrieslandCampina N.V. have asked their suppliers to cease buying palm oil from plantation owner Astra Agro Lestari (AALI.JK), accused by environmental groups of land and human- rights abuses.
Corporate supply chains are under scrutiny as regulators and investors increasingly consider environmental and social impacts, and as consumers worry about climate change and biodiversity loss.
Environmental groups last year found that Jakarta-based palm oil producer Astra Agro Lestari (AAL) did not obtain consent from local communities before claiming land, improperly disposed of waste and cleared areas leading to flooding in Indonesia.
The findings spurred some major consumer products and packaged food manufacturers, which widely use palm oil, to cut ties with the agricultural company.
AAL late last year said it would appoint ""an independent third party to review the allegations and any other issues that may arise in relation to them,"" and will publish the findings of the review, following the NGO's report.

Doritos maker PepsiCo and FrieslandCampina, which produces Friso infant formula, join companies including Tide manufacturer Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Nescafe owner Nestle SA (NESN.S) in suspending business with AAL.
A PepsiCo spokesperson told Reuters the company is ""engaging with suppliers who continue to source from (AAL) and have asked that they suspend the mills identified as being potentially linked to the grievance and underlying allegations."" PepsiCo does not directly source from AAL, the spokesperson said.
FrieslandCampina said it started examining its relationship with AAL in the fall after receiving critical questions from an environmental nonprofit.
“That motivated us to conduct a further investigation. On the basis of the findings, we asked our supplier to no longer source materials from this supplier,” a spokesperson said.

The survey from National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (NAB.AX) released on Tuesday showed its index of business conditions dipped one point to +17 in January, still well above its long-run average.
The volatile measure of confidence fell back to -4, erasing January's bounce to +6.
""Overall, the survey confirms the ongoing resilience of the economy through the first months of 2023, though we continue to expect a more material slowdown in demand later in the year when the full effect of rate rises has passed through,"" said Alan Oster, NAB's chief economist.
The survey paints a mixed picture for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which cited the strength of business activity as one reason it hiked interest rates to a decade-high of 3.6% this month.

Now, swaps and futures imply only a minor chance the RBA will lift rates at its April meeting, and suggest it could be done tightening altogether.
The survey was conducted from Feb. 20 to 28, so it missed the recent chaos in financial markets after Silicon Valley Bank's collapse.
Conditions were generally upbeat with the survey's measure of sales at a very high +27 in February, supported by historically low unemployment and rapid population growth.
Measures of employment edged up 1 point to +11, while profitability eased a touch to +14.
The survey's measure of labour costs ticked up to a quarterly rate of 2.8%, but retail price growth eased to 1.9%.

americas,/world/americas/,Why Canada asylum seekers are using unofficial US border crossings,Anna Mehler Paperny,2023-03-11 16:53:00+00:00,,"CHAMPLAIN, New York and WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Bookseller Zulema Diaz fled her native Peru after being kidnapped, beaten and robbed, hoping to find safety in the United States. Instead, she said she experienced homelessness and sexual harassment as she worked off-the-books on a hospital cleaning crew.
So when Diaz, 46, heard New York City was distributing free bus tickets, she said she hopped on a bus for Plattsburgh, a town close to the Canadian border, then took a taxi to the irregular crossing at Roxham Road to enter Canada and file an asylum claim.
A sharp increase in asylum seekers entering Canada through unofficial crossings -- including many whose bus fares were paid by New York City and aid agencies -- is intensifying the pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to reach an agreement with President Joe Biden to close off the entire land border to most asylum seekers.
Canadian immigration minister Sean Fraser discussed irregular migration with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in Washington, D.C., this week. Trudeau has said he would raise the issue when Biden visits Ottawa on March 23-24.

Many of the arrivals abandoned plans to seek asylum in the United States, deterred by long processing times and restrictive definitions for asylum, according to aid officials and interviews with asylum seekers.
On a snowy day in late February, about three dozen asylum seekers, some wheeling suitcases, others carrying backpacks, trudged along a snow path from New York State to Quebec.
For Diaz, the city's payment of the roughly $150 fare to Plattsburgh offered an extra incentive for a decision she had been weighing for months.
""This presented itself like a miracle,"" she said. After arriving in the U.S. in June last year, she was given a January 2024 date to appear in U.S. immigration court.
""I felt protected in the United States, it just takes a long time to process the documents.""
New York City has been providing bus and plane tickets to homeless people who can demonstrate a source of support in other cities and countries since 2007. Refugee aid groups began offering free bus tickets to migrants in August last year but said they stopped in November for cost reasons. New York City said it began its effort in September.
The office of New York City Mayor Eric Adams would not say how many tickets the city and partnered charity organizations purchased for migrants. Reuters requested comment from mayoral spokespeople Kate Smart and Fabien Levy; the mayor's immigrant affairs office; the Department of Homeless Services, and SLSCO, the contractor that handles the ticket distribution.
Smart said migrants choose their destinations.
""To be clear, New York City has not sent people to anywhere in Canada,"" Smart said. ""We want to help asylum seekers stabilize their lives whether in New York City or elsewhere.""
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on processing times in the U.S. asylum system. The Biden administration has called on Congress to overhaul immigration laws.
Almost 40,000 asylum seekers entered Canada through irregular border crossings from the United States last year -- nine times higher than in 2021, when pandemic restrictions were still in place, and more than double the nearly 17,000 who crossed in 2019. Almost 5,000 entered in January alone, according to the most recent figures from the Canadian government.
Canada accepted more than 46% of irregular asylum claims in the 12-month period ending Sept. 30, according to Canadian government data. U.S. immigration courts approved 14% of asylum claims in the same period, according to U.S. government data.
At the end of last year, Canada had more than 70,000 pending refugee claims. The United States had about 788,000 pending asylum cases in U.S. immigration court.
Nigerian, Haitian and Colombian nationals accounted for nearly half of the irregular claims in Canada, according to previously unreported data from the Immigration and Refugee Board.
While the Safe Third Country Agreement allows U.S. and Canadian officials to turn back asylum seekers in both directions at formal ports of entry, it does not apply to unofficial crossings like Roxham Road.
A Canadian government official who was not authorized to speak on the record told Reuters the U.S. has little incentive to agree to expand the agreement to the entire 4,000-mile border.
Asylum seekers in the United States wait more than four years on average to appear in immigration court, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. It takes at least six months after filing a refugee claim to get a work permit, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
""People are discouraged with the long, long timeline they have for getting working papers and asylum hearings,"" said Ilze Thielmann, director of Team TLC NYC, which aids migrants arriving in New York.
In Canada the average processing time for refugee claims was 25 months in the first 10 months of 2022. That’s up from 15 months in 2019, according to the Immigration and Refugee Board.
Raymond Theriault, 47, said he left his home in the Nicaraguan mining town of Bonanza aiming to connect with relatives in Canada, where he said his late father was born.
Theriault said he had struggled to find steady work and that local officials blocked him from opening a small seafood restaurant after he criticized the government.
After crossing into the U.S. at El Paso in November, he visited a daughter in West Virginia entering Canada at Roxham Road last month. In New York City, he paid $140 for a bus ticket to Plattsburgh.
Now at a government-paid hotel in Niagara Falls, he said he is happy with his decision to go to Canada.
""There is more support, they're more humanitarian,"" he said. ""In the United States ... if you die of hunger, that's your problem.""
The Quebec government has said the increase in asylum seekers is straining its capacity to house people and provide basic services. The federal government said it has relocated more than 5,500 asylum seekers to other provinces since June, the first time it has done so.
In his downtown Montreal office, refugee lawyer Pierre-Luc Bouchard said he has never been so busy.
""I have limited resources. I can't take everybody,"" he said. ""My staff is getting tired of saying 'No.'""
RISING NUMBERS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS
Irregular crossings into the United States are also increasing.
U.S. Border Patrol said it apprehended more than 2,200 people crossing between ports of entry in the four months since October, nearly as many as in all of fiscal year 2022. The force said it deployed an additional 25 agents to the stretch of border that includes Champlain, New York, where most migrants were apprehended.
Immigration experts said closing off the border to asylum seekers could push migrants to take even riskier routes. Last year an Indian family of four froze to death in Canada's province of Manitoba as they were trying to cross the border into the United States.
""You’re just going to see people making more risky and dangerous choices and we’re going to see more tragedies happen,"" said University of Ottawa immigration law professor Jamie Chai Yun Liew.

middle-east,/world/middle-east/,A new intifada? Young Palestinian fighters rise as West Bank boils,Ali Sawafta,2023-03-14 06:09:00+00:00,,"JERICHO, West Bank, March 14 (Reuters) - Before a group of young men from Aqabat Jabr refugee camp mounted a botched attack on a restaurant in Jericho popular with Israeli settlers in January, they declared allegiance to Hamas.
That was a surprise to their families - and to Hamas.
""They weren't members of Al Qassam until that moment,"" said Wael Awdat, father of Ibrahim and Rafat, two members of the group, using the name of the armed wing of Hamas. ""They had a normal life. This was something personal.""
Their story illustrates the complex mix of spontaneous action and association between established factions and new groups during an upsurge in violence in the occupied West Bank that has fuelled fears of a new Palestinian intifada to follow the uprisings of the 1980s and early 2000s.
Alienated from mainstream Palestinian leadership and raised in an era of social media, a new generation of Palestinians has formed a clutch of militant groups, from the Lion's Den based in Nablus to the Jenin Brigade.
View 2 more stories 
Often with just a handful of fighters, the militant groups springing up across the West Bank over the past year have only loose ties to factions such as Hamas, Fatah or Islamic Jihad.
With tight surveillance making it impossible to operate normally in the West Bank, Hamas, which runs the blockaded Gaza Strip, is relying on more flexible, informal networks to avoid detection, two Hamas officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of Israeli reprisals.
A Hamas cadre in Jericho, normally a tranquil city, popular as a weekend getaway spot near the Dead Sea, told Reuters the movement had not known of the cell behind the restaurant attack but said: ""Any faction would be happy to claim them as members.""
A few days after the attack, which failed when a gun jammed, the young men in the group were killed in an Israeli raid.
""All the signs are that the intifada is coming,"" said the Hamas cadre, who declined to be named for fear of Israeli reprisals. ""There is a new generation of people who believe the only solution is armed struggle.""
Spontaneous offshoots of the established factions, such as the previously unknown Aqabat Jabr Battalion formed by the Awdat brothers and their friends, have proliferated.
""Today we have a new generation that is aware of the resistance, and this is a generation that knows the ferocity of occupation,"" said one masked young fighter at a rally in Jenin this month, with the colours of Al Qassam around his head.
""It does not fear arrest, injury or martyrdom. It is not afraid of anything,"" he told Reuters.
With no central leadership, the groups get their message out though songs, TikTok videos and posters of fighters on walls, offering a model to young men angered by what they feel as repeated humiliations by Israeli soldiers and settlers.
""The number of fighters is growing all the time and the enemy needs to know that violence against our people and our camps is increasing their number not reducing it,"" a masked gunman from the Jenin Brigade said.
Over the past year, Israeli forces have carried out near-daily raids in the West Bank as part of a crackdown started in the wake of a spate of deadly attacks in Israel by Palestinians.
More than 200 Palestinians, including both militants and civilians have been killed - about 80 this year alone - while over 40 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in Israel, the West Bank or around Jerusalem.
As the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Passover approach, fears of more violence have grown, with a flood of weapons being smuggled in from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Israel itself, Palestinian and Israeli officials say.
""It's proper weapons, it's M16s, Kalashnikovs, it's pistols, it's ammunition, it's not weapons you can make at home, it's weapons that countries buy,"" said a senior Israeli officer, who spoke to Reuters on condition he would not be named.
In addition, the officer said the new generation of militants were using social media effectively to mobilise.
""We have the most lethal weapon there is, that nobody talks about, which is the telephone, so on social media networks very easily things pass from hand to hand over TikTok, etc,"" he said.
While the lack of leadership has reduced the political focus of the new groups, Israeli officers say their fluid nature and the large number of lone attackers, with no known militant connections, has made them much harder to control.
Incidents such as the Feb. 26 shooting of two Israelis in the West Bank by a Hamas gunman that triggered a revenge rampage by hundreds of settlers against the nearby Palestinian village of Huwara have shown the volatility of the situation.
The violence has been constant, taking place amid a daily experience for Palestinians of confrontations with soldiers at checkpoints who have stepped up the search for ""lone wolf"" attackers, or with Israeli settlers, some of whom taunt and attack Palestinians with apparent impunity.
As one killing succeeds another, there have been increasingly urgent pleas for calm from an alarmed international community. But neither Israel, now run by one of the most right-wing, nationalist religious governments in its history, nor the Palestinian fighters, appear ready to back down.
""What do I fear? No, I carry my weapons and stand against the army,"" said Ahmed Ghoneim, whose two brothers were killed in an Israeli raid in January, at a parade in the Jenin refugee camp on March 3 to honour a founder of the Jenin Brigade.
The rally was a classic display of force, with some 250 fighters from various factions parading in a courtyard, its walls plastered with pictures of their dead, posing with guns and the cropped hairstyles popular among young West Bank men.
Four days later, Israeli security forces raided the camp, killing at least six gunmen, including the Hamas member behind the Feb. 26 Huwara shooting. Two days after that, three Islamic Jihad gunmen were killed in a raid nearby and on Sunday, three Lion's Den militants died in a shootout with Israeli forces.
Israeli officials often blame the surge in violence on a Palestinian Authority that nominally exercises a limited degree of rule in the West Bank but which is in reality effectively powerless in flashpoint areas such as Jenin.
To make matters worse, the Authority has been preoccupied for months with the future of its 87-year-old President Mahmoud Abbas, whose eventual exit risks setting off a factional power struggle.
For its part, the Palestinian Authority says its control is constantly undermined by Israeli actions, which both weaken its authority and fuel resentment among the young, already struggling with high unemployment and scarce prospects.
The bitterness has now spread from radical fringes to affect even comparatively well-off Palestinians, such as the Awdat brothers, neither of whom fitted the classic profile of disaffected young men with no education or prospects.
Speaking outside his house in Aqabat Jabr, a relatively calm area that resembles a rural village more than the crowded camps in Nablus or Jenin, their father, Wael Awdat, said his sons had appeared happy.
Ibrahim, 27, operated a water tanker business in Aqabat Jabr and, like his 22-year-old brother Rafat, an electrician, had done two years of college. One member of their cell had a poultry business and drove a recent model BMW, Awdat said.
""It's a good life here, it's like a family in the camp,"" he said. ""But there is something bad happening every day. At some point, everyone reacts.""

uk,/world/uk/,"In a health system in crisis, Britain's heart care suffers",Alistair Smout,2023-02-02 11:38:00+00:00,,"COLCHESTER, England, Feb 2 (Reuters) - In April 2021, Garry Cogan felt a slow, burning pain move steadily higher through his right arm. It was the start of a major heart attack that doctors warned could shave decades off his life without timely triple-bypass surgery.
Nearly two years later Cogan is still waiting for an operation from Britain's overwhelmed health service, one of millions to suffer as it buckles under the weight of an ageing population, a lack of investment and the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It's made me feel very uneasy in myself, very tentative about what I can and cannot do,"" said the 62-year-old warehouse worker from Colchester, southeast England, who has reduced his working week to three days out of fear he could trigger another attack.
He is one of a record 7.2 million people in England waiting for treatment in Britain's National Health Service, or NHS, built after World War Two to provide care for all, free at the point of use from the cradle to the grave.

Long a source of national pride, its decline now dominates the headlines in Britain and videos on social media show people being treated in corridors and waiting for hours on trolleys, while ambulances queue outside, unable to secure a bed in full emergency wards.
Britain's cardiology departments are a microcosm of the problems that have spread through the system. Staff shortages and years of stagnant investment are straining wards to their limits, with life-threatening consequences for patients.
Sonya Babu-Narayan, a practicing consultant cardiologist in London, described a ""cardiovascular crisis"" in Britain, with excess deaths due to cardiovascular disease remaining high after the pandemic, while deaths from cancer and other conditions had begun to fall back towards average trends.
The British Heart Foundation charity says full treatment after a heart attack should begin within 18 weeks but a third of patients are currently not being seen within that time. In November, around 8,000 people like Cogan had been waiting more than a year for heart treatment, up from a couple of dozen pre-pandemic.
Since the pandemic began, the combination of COVID-19 and the resulting disruption to care has meant an average of more than 230 people have been dying a week with heart disease than would normally be expected, the charity said, and rates have remained high even as deaths from COVID infection fall.
There are signs that after-effects of the pandemic are disrupting regular care and operations.
For example, for one specific heart condition, cardiomyopathy, four times as many people are being diagnosed only when they reach a hospital compared to before the pandemic, charity Cardiomyopathy UK has found, indicating the illness is not being spotted earlier at regular check ups.
When a heart attack happens, cardiologists say a patient needs to be in an ambulance in 18 minutes. At the time of Cogan's heart attack, the average wait time was 20 minutes. In December, the average ambulance wait time for such patients was 93 minutes, NHS data shows.
In response to a Reuters question about the excess death data and care delays, NHS England said cardiac patients were among the people waiting the longest for treatment, but that the number of patients waiting 18 months or more had fallen. In November, the number waiting 18 months was 44% lower compared to the same month in 2021, NHS data showed.
Teams were still trying to restore cardiac services to pre-pandemic levels, NHS England said.
""Covid has inevitably had an impact with fewer people coming forward for care,"" a spokesperson said.
Babu-Narayan said that as a result of the pandemic, patients stayed away from hospitals and family doctors, made fewer appointments and received less preventative care as a result. Pandemic disruptions to diagnosis and treatment, in addition to delays in emergency care, had an outsized impact on cardiological care, she said.
Shortfalls in capital investment before the pandemic, when the government embarked on a nine-year-long program of fiscal austerity, meant too few beds were available, she said. A cycle of staff shortages compounded the workload of doctors and nurses, in turn driving more to leave the service.
""We're skilled in what to do. We know how to help, but the hospital is full and there aren't enough of us,"" she said, describing the situation as personally deeply distressing.
In its defence, the government says it is pumping record investment into the health service - accounting for 40% of day-to-day government spending.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made fixing NHS England one of his priorities, and has described recent wait times as unacceptable, this week outlining a two-year recovery plan for emergency care.
Admitted to Basildon hospital, 40 miles (64 km) from home, after his heart attack, Cogan was diagnosed with severe coronary disease on the left side. The doctor told him an operation to bypass three clogged arteries should add 25 years to his life and could be carried out within six months.
The operation never materialised. More vague timelines came and went before he was finally given a date for January, 2023, 21 months after the original incident. Then, with just four days to go, the hospital told him it was cancelled, citing a lack of staff and beds.

At one point, Cogan even considered trying to make himself ill, by going for a run so he could ""keel over"" and be operated on immediately, he said.
He now has a new date for his operation, on Feb. 9, but he remains wary and must call the hospital on the morning of the surgery to ask if a bed is available: ""That's the call you don't really want to make.""
Cogan, waiting for his operation, said nurses or doctors - who were depicted affectionately during the opening ceremony of London's 2012 Olympics and applauded in the streets during the pandemic - had been very good when he had seen them. But he said the service was run chaotically.
Even in his condition, he struggled to get an appointment with his local family doctor or to get his medication. On one visit to his local Colchester hospital, staff could not find a working ECG machine to read his heart's electrical activity when he felt a twinge. The two hospitals disagreed over his priority level.
Neill Moloney, Deputy Chief Executive of the NHS Foundation Trust in charge of Colchester Hospital, said the hospital had apologised to Cogan for his experience in 2021, and had since ""reviewed our procedures and made improvements.""
Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation trust, which runs Basildon hospital, said it had treated Cogan in order of clinical priority and that his surgery was scheduled for Feb. 9.
In line with the national picture, where people are turning up at hospital with more things wrong with them, or in a more serious condition, Cogan has also developed a hernia, which cannot be operated on until after his heart operation.
In 2022 England and Wales recorded 45,000 deaths above the 2015-2019 average, making it the deadliest year by this metric since 1951, outside of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Some 2.5 million people are also out of work due to long term sickness, with the lowest paid most affected, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The Bank of England has cited ill-health as one reason for a reduction in the size of the workforce.
It is too soon to know what impact long COVID and large waiting lists have on the workforce, the ONS said, but the government is investigating any link between long-term sickness and people quitting work.
The health service had been struggling long before the pandemic.
Growth in spending on health accelerated under the previous government of the Labour Party, contributing to the longest period of sustained real spending growth in NHS history, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.
And while health spending did not sharply decline when the Conservatives came into power in 2010, it plateaued, and IFS economist Ben Zaranko said Britain's aging population put extra pressure on NHS budgets.
""The NHS was gradually deteriorating in terms of its performance even ahead of the pandemic,"" he told Reuters.
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, health spending as a share of UK economic output averaged less than 10% in the years leading up to the pandemic, compared with rates closer to 12% in Germany, which has 60% more doctors per head than in Britain.
Between 2014 to 2019, the number of British public hospital beds fell by 7% – the sharpest decline among the Group of Seven advanced economies - and The Health Foundation, a charity, estimates the NHS needs a further 103,000 staff to meet demand.
Such is the pressure that nurses went on strike this year for the first time in their union's 106-year history.
Analysts say that while recent additional funding could help pay staff more, it is not enough to transform the NHS, or prepare it for a future with an older population.
The Nuffield Trust think-tank has also found that the registration of doctors from the European Union slowed in the years after Britain's 2016 Brexit decision to leave the European Union, possibly exacerbating staff shortages.
Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund, a charity that works to improve health outcomes, said the combination of structural problems and pressures from COVID means it could take a decade before the NHS hits its targets again.
""There is no short term fix here,"" he told Reuters.

At a time when major Hollywood studios have taken refuge in the familiar, releasing sequels and rehashing old ideas, A24 is cementing a reputation for taking risks on original projects that other studios pass on -- including the frenetic, chaotic “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” which is its highest-grossing movie at $107.4 million globally.
“In this moment, they are not only the leading indie company, but they also have created a brand that probably resonates more with its customers than any other independent ever – more than Miramax,” said Picturehouse CEO Bob Berney, a well-regarded executive in the world of independent film. “Their biggest achievement is that they’ve created a super-cool brand that has a following.”
This year, A24 will build on that momentum and lift its film, television and documentary production by 30%, according to a source familiar with the matter, riding the wave of industry acclaim and its 2022 box office success.
Forthcoming releases this year include the love story “Past Lives,” which screened to a rapturous critical reception at the Berlin film festival; the dark comedy series “Beef” for Netflix (NFLX.O), in which Ali Wong and Steven Yeun portray two strangers whose lives collide in a road-rage episode; and the Steph Curry documentary “Underrated” for Apple TV+.
“It’s very much a dream studio, because they make movies that feel so auteur-focused,” said playwright and ""Past Lives"" director Celine Song, who said that the studio enables first-time directors like herself to “speak in their own voice.”
The New York-based company founded by three film executives -- Daniel Katz, David Fenkel and John Hodges, who has since departed -- got its start in 2012 distributing such films as “Spring Breakers.” Some of its box office success has come from the horror genre, with such critically acclaimed films as “Hereditary” and “Midsommar.” It earned a reputation as a Hollywood tastemaker with such director-driven projects as “Lady Bird,” “Moonlight” and “Uncut Gems.”
This year, A24's 18 Academy Award nominations were across six films, ranking second only to the giant Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N). It collected its first nods for best animated feature, “Marcel the Shell With Shoes On;” best foreign film, “Close;” and outstanding makeup and hairstyling, “The Whale.” Eight performers in A24 films received first-time acting nominations including Yeoh, Quan, Curtis and Fraser.
The first film A24 produced and financed, together with Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment, was “Moonlight,” which won the Oscar for best picture in 2017. The studio has garnered 53 Oscar nominations in less than a decade, including best picture nods for “Lady Bird, “Minari” and “Room.”
A24's film slate has grown at the pace of its cash flow - starting with three movies in 2016 to 15 in 2022. Midway through the global lockdown, it resumed movie making using its in-house production capabilities. This year, it’s on track to produce about 15 films for theatrical release, eight documentaries and 10 television shows.
The studio’s frugal use of capital -- A24’s film budgets range from $5 million to $50 million -- give it the flexibility to take more creative swings, according to the source close to the studio.
“They are willing to take risks and take chances on filmmakers and on stories that other people might not be,” said Claudette Godfrey, vice president of film and television for the SXSW festival. “I think that is what makes it interesting and I think that's why we ended up kind of aligning with them.”
The studio, which now employs 200 people working in New York, Los Angeles and London, eschews traditional movie marketing campaigns in favor of digital promotions, like the rubber “hot dog fingers” and googly eyes from “Everything Everywhere All at Once” that took TikTok by storm.
A24's financial success at the box office has allowed it to expand its creative portfolio.
About nine years ago, it began producing television shows in addition to films, winning critical praise for Hulu's “Ramy,” a comedy series centered around a first-generation American Muslim, and HBO’s Emmy-winning drama series “Euphoria.”
The studio is developing shows for several streaming services and television networks, including a pair of HBO series: “The Sympathizer,” a $100 million television adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel starring Robert Downey Jr., and “The Idol"" from the creators of “Euphoria” and The Weeknd.
It's also developing “Sunny,” a thriller for Apple TV+ starring Rashida Jones and Hidetoshi Nishijima.
The global reach of the streaming platforms, together with an infusion of $225 million from investors including Stripes and Neuberger Berman, on behalf of client funds, serve to fan A24's ambitions, as it ramps up production and expands into new genres.
“A24 has over time developed a well-earned reputation as a powerful force in the world of independent cinema,” said Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian, “whose name has come to represent quality awards-caliber filmed entertainment and now ranks among the most influential and respected purveyors of quality cinema with both filmmakers and audiences.”

sustainable-business,/business/sustainable-business/,Greenwashing crackdown in Europe leaves investors in the dark,Virginia Furness,2023-03-10 17:10:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PSSHR5JCJ5LU7GUAT6GRIZUV2A.jpg,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - New rules in Europe to crack down on greenwashing are not making it easier to spot genuine environmentally-friendly funds as asset managers continue to apply different standards for what constitutes sustainable investing.
More than 30 fund managers, consultants, lawyers and regulators interviewed by Reuters said that despite European Union rules demanding more disclosure, funds remained hard to compare and greenwashing difficult to spot.
A surge in demand for green investments has led to a rush by investment managers to label products as sustainable, when often portfolios still include carbon-intensive businesses.
The European Commission has tried to provide more clarity with its Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), initially launched in March 2021, which aims to outlaw misleading claims.
Last year, the Commission clarified the rules to require fund managers dedicated to pursuing sustainable investments -- known as Article 9 funds under the SFDR -- to have 100% of their portfolio in environmentally-friendly companies.
View 2 more stories 
The SFDR defines sustainable investment as contributing to ""an environmental or social objective"", assessed by indicators such as use of raw materials or production of waste.
The regime got tougher in January with more detailed disclosures required to resolve problems identified since the rules were introduced.
But the Commission's latest efforts have not cleared up the greenwashing muddle for funds domiciled in the EU and governed by the SFDR, which had a face value of 8.4 trillion euros ($8.88 trillion) at end-December, according to fund management specialist Morningstar.
The people Reuters spoke to said discrepancies among fund portfolios reflected a lack of clarity from the Commission over what constitutes a sustainable investment.
""One of the objectives was to fight greenwashing and we are really at a stage now where the way the regulation is being implemented doesn't help prevent it,"" said Mathilde Dufour, head of sustainability research at French asset manager Mirova.
The Commission's changes aim to plug gaps that allowed funds branding themselves as sustainable to invest in everything from oil to tobacco.
In response, many funds downgraded the classification of their funds at the end of last year from Article 9 to the less demanding Article 8, which requires sustainability to be only one of the factors informing investment decisions.
Alena Kosava, head of investment research at AJ Bell, one of Britain's biggest retail investment platforms, said the current lack of clarity and transparency meant investors were vulnerable to paying higher fees for funds that may not deliver on their advertised green status or fairly reflect the underlying sustainability risks.
""Article 9 can often be offered at a premium and could be seen as a cash cow [for managers] but investors cannot often be certain that fund groups are doing what is necessary,"" she said.
The new regime has not resolved the inconsistencies in the portfolios claiming green credentials.
For example, data provided to Reuters by Morningstar shows that as of mid-January more than 100 out of 891 Article 9 funds in Europe were invested in some aspect of thermal coal, a big climate change contributor.
In the Nuveen Global Clean Infrastructure Impact Fund, for example, 29% of companies were directly or indirectly exposed to thermal coal, which Morningstar said could be through activities such as mining, coal-power generation or providing services to the sector.
Nordea, BlackRock and Macquarie also run funds which had over 8% exposure to the fuel, the Morningstar data showed.
A Nuveen spokesperson told Reuters it applied revenue threshold limits to investing in coal-based power generation, but declined to specify what they were. They also said the investments were justified to facilitate ""an orderly and effective energy transition"".
Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investments at Nordea Asset Management, also said the investments were in line with its energy transition planning.
A Macquarie spokesperson said its fund's coal exposure was linked to power generation investments where the companies had agreed to phase out its use.
A BlackRock spokesperson said its fund's exposure ""was linked to legacy power generation investments where the companies are investing heavily into renewable energy, which is helping decarbonise electricity generation for the economies they serve.""
There is no explicit rule against thermal coal in Article 9 and the market is seeking clarity from the Commission on whether any fossil fuel investments have a place in an Article 9 fund, Hortense Bioy, global director of sustainability research at Morningstar, said.
The French financial regulator proposed in February that Article 9 should exclude fossil fuel activities that are not aligned with the EU's taxonomy, a list of environmentally friendly activities.
MSCI, the finance industry data provider, has developed a way of checking on investment funds' green credentials with its ESG Implied Temperature Rise tool.
This is used by the funds industry, while some fund managers also have their own versions to keep track at the portfolio level.
When analysed using MSCI's tool, 16 of the 20 biggest Article 9 funds, as ranked by Morningstar, are not currently aligned with a goal agreed by governments in 2015 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
The MSCI tool assesses the funds' portfolio emissions relative to the maximum amount of carbon that can be emitted globally and still hit the world's climate target.
Among them, for example, are BlackRock's Sustainable Energy Fund, Nordea's Global Climate and Environment Fund and Pictet's Global Environmental Opportunities Fund.
Pictet Asset Management's head of ESG Eric Borremans and Nordea's Pedersen said implied temperature rise estimates in general are methodologies in their infancy and should not be used on their own to assess the sustainability of a fund's portfolio.
BlackRock declined to comment.
Mirova's Dufour said Article 8 funds now accounted for more than half the European market and deployed a wide range of strategies that were particularly hard to compare.
Stuart Ballard, head of product strategy and development at asset manager Federated Hermes, said the SFDR's loose definition can result ""in one asset manager considering a particular stock to be a sustainable investment and another asset manager not considering that to be a sustainable investment.""
The Commission said in December it would answer some of the questions posed by investors ""early next year"" and would begin a ""comprehensive assessment"" of SFDR.
When asked for comment by Reuters, a Commission spokesperson made reference to the December speech by Commissioner Mairead McGuinness. The Commission did not respond to a further request for comment.
National regulators in EU member states, responsible for monitoring the SFDR enforcement, have only sanctioned a handful of funds for breaches.
Denmark's market watchdog in February ordered eight funds to take remedial action after finding they had violated SFDR because of insufficient disclosures.
Henrik Brarup Damgaard, Director, Head of ESG supervision at the Danish market regulator, said: ""There are some areas where there has been a need for dialogue with the industry and where the Commission has or will be providing further guidance.""
A spokesperson for the financial regulator in Ireland, home to a substantial number of funds, told Reuters it was reviewing local fund disclosures, as are regulators in Luxembourg, the EU's largest fund hub.
A spokesperson for Luxembourg regulator the CSSF said the development of the regulatory framework had triggered an increase in demand for products with sustainability features, but there was generally no binding definition of greenwashing available in the EU regime.
""The characterisation of what constitutes a sustainable investment under the SFDR is also a concept that needs further clarifications at European level.""

World,/world/eyeing-china-biden-allies-unveil-nuclear-powered-submarine-plan-australia-2023-03-13/,"Eyeing China, Biden and allies unveil nuclear-powered submarine plan for Australia",Steve Holland,2023-03-14 06:07:00+00:00,,"SAN DIEGO/CANBERRA, March 14 (Reuters) - The United States, Australia and Britain unveiled details of a plan to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines from the early 2030s to counter China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific.
Addressing a ceremony at the U.S. naval base on Monday in San Diego, accompanied by Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, U.S. President Joe Biden called the agreement under the 2021 AUKUS partnership part of a shared commitment to a free-and-open Indo-Pacific region with two of America's ""most stalwart and capable allies.""
Sunak called it ""a powerful partnership,"" adding: ""For the first time ever it will mean three fleets of submarines working together across the Atlantic and Pacific keeping our oceans free ... for decades to come.""
Under the deal, which was welcomed by its Asian allies on Tuesday but has angered Beijing, the United States intends to sell Australia three U.S. Virginia class nuclear-powered submarines, which are built by General Dynamics, in the early 2030s, with an option for Australia to buy two more if needed, a joint statement said.
View 2 more stories 
It said the multi-stage project would culminate with British and Australian production and operation of a new submarine class - SSN-AUKUS - a ""trilaterally developed"" vessel based on Britain's next-generation design that would be built in Britain and Australia and include ""cutting edge"" U.S. technologies.
Britain would take delivery of its first SSN-AUKUS submarine in the late 2030s, and Australia would receive its first in the early 2040s. The vessels will be built by BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce.
""The AUKUS agreement we confirm here in San Diego represents the biggest single investment in Australia’s defence capability in our history, strengthening Australia’s national security and stability in our region,"" Albanese said at the ceremony.
AUKUS will be the first time Washington has shared nuclear-propulsion technology since it did so with Britain in the 1950s.
Biden stressed that the submarines would be nuclear-powered, not nuclear armed: ""These boats will not have nuclear weapons of any kind on them,"" he said.
But the deal comes with an eye-watering bill for Australia with cost estimated to go up to A$368 billion ($245 billion) by 2055.
Albanese defended the spending, saying it was ""an economic plan, not just a defence and security plan"".
He said he expected AUKUS would result in A$6 billion invested in Australia’s industrial capability over the next four years and create about 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30. He said it would require funding amounting to about 0.15% of GDP per year.
Australia's defence minister, Richard Marles, said it was an investment in the nation's security.
""It is an investment that we cannot afford not to make,"" Marles told a news conference in Canberra.
China has condemned AUKUS as an illegal act of nuclear proliferation. The plan ""constitutes serious nuclear proliferation risks, undermines international non-proliferation system, fuels arms races, and hurts peace and stability,"" China's permanent mission to the United Nations said in a tweet after the announcement.
Asked if he was worried China would see the AUKUS submarine deal as aggression, Biden replied ""no."" He said he expected to speak to Chinese leader Xi Jinping soon, but would not say when.
U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan pointed on Friday to Beijing's own military buildup, including nuclear-powered submarines, saying: ""We have communicated with them about AUKUS and sought more information from them about their intentions.""

Australia offered China a briefing on the submarine deal, Australian Defence Minister Richard Marles said.
In launching the partnership, Australia also upset France by abruptly cancelling a deal to buy French conventional submarines.
The agreement will see U.S. and British submarines deployed in Western Australia as soon as 2027 to help train Australian crews and bolster deterrence. U.S. officials said this would involve four U.S. submarines and one British in a few years.
This first phase of the plan is already underway with the U.S. Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarine Asheville visiting Perth in Western Australia, officials said.
The U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, Daniel Kritenbrink, said in a media briefing on Tuesday that the U.S. had informed its partners in South East Asia about the AUKUS plan, including in Indonesia and Malaysia, last week ""to explain clearly what AUKUS is and what AUKUS is not"".
A senior U.S. official said AUKUS reflected mounting Indo-Pacific threats, not just from China towards self-ruled Taiwan and in the contested South China Sea, but also from Russia, which has conducted joint exercises with China, and North Korea as well.
Taiwan's foreign ministry welcomed the deal, saying it would help combat ""authoritarian expansion"" in the region.
""The cooperation between the three parties will strengthen the deterrence capabilities of democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region and help maintain regional peace and stability,"" it said in a statement.
Albanese called Japan Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Tuesday to brief him on the launch, with Kishida saying the deal ""will contribute to regional peace and stability, and that Japan has consistently supported this initiative,"" his foreign ministry said in a statement.
Big questions remain about AUKUS, not least over strict U.S. curbs on the extensive technology sharing needed for the project and about how long it will take to deliver the submarines, even as the perceived threat posed by China mounts.
In a reflection of stretched U.S. production capacity, a second senior U.S. official told Reuters it was ""very likely"" one or two of the Virginia-class submarines sold to Australia would be vessels that had been in U.S. service, something that would require congressional approval.
Analysts said that given China's growing power and threats to take Taiwan by force if necessary, it was vital to advance the second stage of AUKUS, which involves hypersonics and other weaponry that can be deployed more quickly.
British and Australian officials said this month work was still needed to break down bureaucratic barriers to technology sharing and Monday's announcement did not cover this second stage.
The second U.S. official said Australia would contribute to boosting U.S. and British submarine production and maintenance capacity.
He said Washington was looking at ""double digit billion"" investment in its submarine industrial base on top of $4.6 billion already committed for 2023-29 and that the Australian contribution would be less than 15 percent of the total.
Britain, which left the European Union in 2020, says AUKUS will help boost its economy's low growth rate. Sunak said AUKUS was ""binding ties to our closest allies and delivering security, new technology and economic advantage at home.""

The AUKUS agreement to provide Australia with nuclear- powered submarines is aimed at countering China in the Indo-Pacific and Beijing has condemned it as an illegal act of nuclear proliferation.
""Competition requires dialogue and diplomacy,"" Sullivan told a small group of reporters last week in reference to China while discussing AUKUS. ""We encourage the PRC (People's Republic of China) to have regularized patterns of communications at senior levels.""
Asked when a call with Xi might happen, Sullivan replied: ""When the People's Congress is over and the government, including the president, return to work in Beijing the (U.S.) president anticipates the opportunity to engage in a phone call.""
""Over the course of 18 months we have communicated with (China) about AUKUS and sought more information from them about their intentions,"" Sullivan added, referring to China's military buildup, including nuclear powered submarines.
China's foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a regular briefing on Tuesday that both China and the U.S. were maintaining necessary communication.
""We believe that the value and significance of communication is to enhance the level of understanding and manage our differences, not to communicate for the sake of communicating. The U.S. side should come forward sincerely, with practical actions to promote China-U.S. relations,"" Wang said.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Xi plans to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That call was likely to take place after Xi's visit to Moscow next week to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, the newspaper said.
Sullivan told reporters en route to San Diego on Monday that Washington has been publicly and privately encouraging Xi to talk to Zelenskiy so that they hear ""not just the Russian perspective"" on the war.
Sullivan added that Ukraine had not confirmed a call between Xi and Zelenskiy.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,"Learning from Ukraine, Taiwan shows off its drones as key to 'asymmetric warfare'",Yimou Lee,2023-03-14 05:49:00+00:00,,"TAICHUNG, Taiwan, March 14 (Reuters) - Taiwan showcased new models of its domestically produced military drones on Tuesday, saying they are key to its ""asymmetric warfare"" capacity to make its forces more agile if they have to face a far larger Chinese military.
China, which has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, has ramped up military activity near the democratically governed island to force it to accept Chinese sovereignty despite Taiwan's objections.
The war in Ukraine has lent new urgency to Taiwan military's efforts to bolster defence including a push to develop drones.
In a rare display of its drone capabilities, the military-owned National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), showed off its latest models, including the Albatross II surveillance drone, and combat drones that operate with global positioning system satellites.

NCSIST head Art Chang said the war in Ukraine had focused attention on drones, and his institution had teamed up with Taiwan companies to build a ""national team"" to develop military drones.
Taiwan's military has announced a partnership with companies aimed at producing 3,000 drones next year.
Chi Li-Pin, director of Aeronautical Systems Research Division for NCSIST, said the armed forces should increase their adoption of drones in their strategies.
""I hope our national troops can familiarise themselves with this weapon of asymmetric warfare and use them boldly,"" he told reporters at an NCSIST facility in the central city of Taichung.
President Tsai Ing-wen has championed the idea of ""asymmetric warfare"" to make Taiwan's forces more mobile and harder to attack.
Taiwan's armed forces are well-equipped but still dwarfed by China's.
Among the drones on display was an attack drone with loitering munitions that can cruise towards a target before plummeting at velocity and detonating on impact.
China has sent its drones to areas close to Taiwan to test its responses, the island's defence ministry has said.
Last year, Taiwan shot down a civilian drone that entered its airspace near an islet off the Chinese coast.
The island's defence ministry said in a report to parliament this week, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, that China was quickly building up its combat capacity with drones, including swarms of flying robots.
In response, Taiwan will focus on developing its combat and surveillance drones, as well as anti-drone systems, the ministry said.

World,/world/europe/,"Returning to frontline, Ukrainian Leopard crews see their 'cat' as game-changer",Sabine Siebold,2023-03-13 19:09:00+00:00,,"BERGEN TRAINING GROUND, Germany, March 13 (Reuters) - Ukrainian troops fired the 120mm guns of their Leopard tanks at a German shooting range on Monday, a few days before they were due to return home with the ""cats"" they hope will give Kyiv a breakthrough in what has become a grinding war of attrition.
Muzzle flashes could be seen, and dust clouds where the shells hit the ground, as four tanks fought their way through a muddy dip to what was marked as an enemy position two kilometres away, destroying wooden pop-up targets as they rattled along.
On a hill overlooking the drills at Bergen training ground in northern Germany, the commander of the EU training mission for Ukraine had to raise his voice to avoid being drowned out by the roaring gunshots as he praised the Leopard's benefits.
Vice Admiral Herve Blejean told reporters Kyiv's forces were facing the most dangerous phase since Russia's invasion more than a year ago, holding the frontline against what he described as a ""tsunami"" of more than 300,000 Russian combatants.
View 2 more stories 
""When they will be able to involve better tanks like (the) Leopard, they will be able to break through and to look at counter-attacking,"" Blejean said, adding he was confident the German tanks would be a key element in Kyiv's spring offensive.
Germany agreed in January to supply the tanks, regarded as one of the best in the West's arsenal, overcoming misgivings about sending heavy weaponry that Kyiv sees as crucial to defeat Russia's invasion but Moscow casts as a dangerous provocation.
Last week, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius stated all 18 modern Leopard 2 A6 tanks pledged by Berlin would reach Ukraine before the end of March.
In Bergen, the German trainers were happy with the Ukrainians' performance over their six-week crash course.
""Hitting more than 80% (of the targets in the exercise), that's an excellent result after such a short time,"" said one of the trainers who only gave his first name of Joerg.
Still, the Ukrainians had to abandon some of their old tactics.
""At the start, the Ukrainian crews wanted to turn the tanks around (instead of reversing),"" said Colonel Michael Sack, attributing this to the fact that Russian tanks can only reverse slowly which makes them vulnerable to hostile fire.
The Leopard, however, can drive backwards fast while firing as it keeps facing the enemy with its more heavily armoured front, he argued.
The Ukrainians also trained in the dark, to make best use of what is seen as the Leopard's superior night vision equipment.
Asked about his feelings as the Ukrainians prepared to return to the battlefield, Joerg said it was a question of professionalism to blend out emotions.
""We are soldiers. Of course, they are not heading for the training ground but directly into battle. But that's exactly what motivates us so much in doing this training,"" he said.
One of the Ukrainian gunners rejected any talk of fear but warned the Russians to brace for the arrival of the Leopard.
""A friend in Ukrainian intelligence told me the Russians are very nervous because of the modern Leopard 2, as they well should be,"" he said, wearing a scarf pulled up over his face and orange-tinted ballistic glasses to hide his identity.
""The Leopard tanks will enable us to make the breakthroughs that we need. And other Ukrainian units will feel safer, too, when they fight alongside the cat.""

World,/world/us/,Biden wants $886 billion defense budget with eyes on Ukraine and future wars,Mike Stone,2023-03-13 17:11:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/DT4OAXAAXVNSBA3ACB5BWNXLSI.jpg,"WASHINGTON, March 13 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's biggest peacetime U.S. defense budget request of $886 billion includes a 5.2% pay raise for troops and the largest allocation on record for research and development, with Russia's war on Ukraine spurring demand for more spending on munitions.
Biden's request earmarks $842 billion for the Pentagon and $44 billion for defense-related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Energy and other agencies. The total amount of the 2024 budget proposal is $28 billion more than last year's $858 billion.
Congress has signaled, as it often does, it will increase defense spending over Biden's request during the months-long budget process that this request kicks off. The Senate and House typically pass bills setting policy and spending levels for the Pentagon much later in the year.
Congress and the administration both have an eye on a possibly prolonged war in Ukraine and potential future conflicts with Russia and China.

""Our greatest measure of success, and the one we use around here most often, is to make sure the PRC (Peoples Republic of China) leadership wakes up every day, considers the risks of aggression, and concludes, 'today is not the day,'"" Deputy U.S. Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks said on Monday.
Relations between the United States and China have become highly contentious over issues ranging from trade to espionage as increasingly the two powers compete for influence in parts of the world far from their own borders.
""This top line request serves as a useful starting point,"" U.S. Senator Jack Reed, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said when the budget figures were unveiled on Thursday.
This budget will be the first to procure missiles and other munitions with multi-year contracts, something that is routine for planes and ships, as the Pentagon signals enduring demand to top munitions makers such as Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX.N), Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc (AJRD.N).
The Ukraine war has shown the U.S. military it needs to make bigger lots of certain types of munitions, helping to explain the multi-year contracts for weaponry that would potentially also be used in a military conflict with China.
The budget boosts procurement of sophisticated missiles such as the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER), and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). Those ""are for the broader strategy - for a higher end fight. They're not ground munitions,"" like those being used in Ukraine, a senior U.S. defense official said.
 Thus far, funds to backfill the munitions sent to Ukraine, including the JAVELIN and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), were handled by $35.7 billion in supplemental funds enacted in 2022. The Pentagon aid to Ukraine in the budget is the same as the prior year. If more funding is needed for Ukraine, the senior defense official said, another supplemental request could be drawn up. 
 The 2024 budget boasts a historically large research and development budget for the Pentagon - $145 billion earmarked to develop new weaponry like hypersonic missiles, which are fired into the upper atmosphere and can evade even advanced radar systems. Russia has used these missiles in Ukraine.
Biden's budget request also speeds the Department of Defense's pace for buying the stealthy F-35 fighter jet to 83. The F-35 is the Pentagon's largest weapons program and will be the lynchpin of U.S. air power in the near future.
 The 2023 budget request asked for 61 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin and Congress increased that number to 77.
 Among the other top priorities for this budget are modernizing the U.S. nuclear ""triad"" of ballistic missile submarines, bombers and land-based missiles, shipbuilding and developing capabilities in space.
 The budget would benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors including Lockheed, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and General Dynamics Corp (GD.N).
 Some of that investment is funded by asking to retire equipment such as two of the Navy's older Littoral Combat Ships, 32 of the Air Force's non-combat ready F-22 Raptor jet fighters and 42 older A-10 Warthogs, which the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last year has made less essential because they are vulnerable to more sophisticated enemies.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,Exclusive: Seoul mayor calls for South Korean nuclear weapons to counter threat from North,Hyonhee Shin,2023-03-13 02:46:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7QDGKPXVKZNI3MD7ZWORAZMN2I.jpg,"SEOUL, March 13 (Reuters) - South Korea should build nuclear weapons to bolster its defences against North Korea, even at the risk of international repercussions, the mayor of its capital city said, arguing that the country cannot be bound by the goal of denuclearisation.
In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon added new fuel to a growing debate over how South Korea should arm itself as the North races to perfect its capability to strike the South with tactical nuclear weapons.
""North Korea has nearly succeeded in miniaturising and lightening tactical nuclear weapons and secured at least dozens of warheads,"" Oh said. ""We've come to a point where it is difficult to convince people with the logic that we should refrain from developing nuclear weapons and stick to the cause of denuclearisation.""
He has raised the issue before, saying in February that the South should keep the nuclear option available. But his new comments are his strongest yet.
View 2 more stories 
Oh, an influential member of President Yoon Suk Yeol's conservative People Power Party, is one of the highest-profile officials to actively advocate for a South Korean nuclear weapons programme.
He is seen as a likely contender for the presidency in 2027. As mayor, he oversees Seoul's annual civil defence drills and an integrated security mechanism aimed at protecting a metropolitan area that is home to nearly half of the country's 51 million people.
Amid advances in North Koreas' military and doubts over the U.S. commitment or ability to protect the South, a growing number of senior South Korean officials have raised the possibility of developing nuclear weapons or redeploying American tactical nuclear bombs and missiles, which were withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula in the 1990s.
As a candidate, Yoon proposed the U.S. redeployment option, but his administration has since said it remains committed to denuclearisation and would reinforce combined conventional defences with the U.S.
Surveys, however, show unprecedented levels of public support in South Korea for the once unthinkable idea of a homegrown nuclear arsenal.
In a poll released on March 1 by Data Research, more than 70% of South Koreans supported developing nuclear weapons with 27% opposed; 59% said North Korea would probably use nuclear weapons if war breaks out on the peninsula.
Oh said the Ukraine crisis has cemented his conviction that denuclearisation has lost its appeal, and that nuclear weapons would be the most effective deterrent against the North.
""Russia freely violates Ukraine's airspace, flying bombers and firing missiles ... but Ukraine barely attacks Russian territory because of the psychological inferiority to a nuclear state,"" Oh said.
He dismissed opponents who warned of punishments from other countries, including sanctions, saying a South Korean nuclear programme would send a message to countries like China to curb the North's military buildup.
""There may be some initial resistance from the international community, but I believe that it will gain more support eventually,"" he said.
A former senior U.S. official said the increase in rhetoric from the Yoon government seems driven by a desire to pressure the United States into giving South Korea more say in nuclear planning.
Yoon has said U.S. extended deterrence is ""falling short of convincing"" South Koreans, and Washington has agreed to establish more information-sharing and conduct tabletop drills to enable greater allied cooperation.
In a report this month, Lee Sang-hyun, president of South Korea's Sejong Institute, said that Yoon is not seriously considering a nuclear programme and that a return of American weapons was also unlikely.
""However, the Yoon government’s nuclear non-proliferation stance has shown small but significant signs of change in recent months,"" he wrote. ""If North Korea’s nuclear threat becomes more visible and South Korea takes its own path to nuclear development, it will signal the start of a nuclear domino effect in Asia.""

World,/world/europe/,"European arms imports climb, U.S. dominance in exports grows, think tank says",Reuters,2023-03-12 23:16:00+00:00,,"STOCKHOLM, March 13 (Reuters) - European states increased their imports of major weaponry by 47% in the five years to 2022, while the United States' share of global arms exports rose to 40% from 33%, a leading conflict think-tank said on Monday.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, following years of growing tensions, has prompted European countries to rush to bolster their defences.
""Even as arms transfers have declined globally, those to Europe have risen sharply due to the tensions between Russia and most other European states,"" Pieter D. Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), said in a statement.
SIPRI defines major arms as aircraft, warships, tanks, artillery, missiles and various heavy defence systems.
European states in the U.S.-led NATO alliance increased their arms imports by 65% from the previous five-year period. But worldwide, international arms transfers fell 5.1%, according to SIPRI.
The United States and Russia have been the world's largest and second-largest arms exporters for the past three decades.

U.S. arms exports increased by 14% from 2013-17, and the U.S. accounted for 40% of global arms exports. Russia's share fell to 16% from 22%.
""It is likely that the invasion of Ukraine will further limit Russia's arms exports,"" SIPRI's Siemon T. Wezeman said. ""This is because Russia will prioritize supplying its armed forces and demand from other states will remain low due to trade sanctions on Russia.""
In 2022, SIPRI warned that the global nuclear arsenal was likely to grow in the coming years.

World,/world/middle-east/,Iran to buy Su-35 fighter jets from Russia - Iranian broadcaster,Reuters,2023-03-12 05:50:00+00:00,,"DUBAI, March 11 (Reuters) - Iran has reached a deal to buy advanced Su-35 fighter planes from Russia, Iranian state media said on Saturday, expanding a relationship that has seen Iranian-built drones used in Russia's war on Ukraine.
""The Sukhoi-35 fighter planes are technically acceptable to Iran and Iran has finalised a contract for their purchase,"" the broadcaster IRIB quoted Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York as saying.
IRIB's report did not carry any Russian confirmation of the deal, details of which were not disclosed. The mission said Iran had also inquired about buying military aircraft from several other unnamed countries, IRIB reported.
Iran's purchase of Russian fighter jets was first reported by news website Semafor on Thursday.
Russian President Vladimir Putin met Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in Tehran last July, stressing closer ties in the face of Western pressure over the war in Ukraine.

Iran has acknowledged sending drones to Russia but says they were sent before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. Moscow denies that its forces use Iranian-built drones in Ukraine, although many have been shot down and recovered there.
Iran's air force has only a few dozen strike aircraft, including Russian jets as well as ageing U.S. models acquired before the Iranian revolution of 1979.
In 2018, Iran said it had started production of the locally-designed Kowsar fighter for use in its air force. Some military experts believe the jet is a carbon copy of an F-5, first produced in the United States in the 1960s.

A red, white and blue paint scheme for the presidential aircraft, known as Air Force One when the president is on board, was proposed by Donald Trump when he was president, but was scuttled after a study showed it would create too much heat.
The current ""robin's egg"" blue will be slightly ""deeper"", the engines will be a darker blue and the belly will not be polished metal because the jet's alloy does not allow that, the Air Force said.
The contractual decision for a Air Force One paint job ""was not required until this year,"" the Air Force said.

Boeing has racked up $1.9 billion in losses on the $4.3 billion program that is now at least three years behind schedule.

World,/world/asia-pacific/,"South Australia to be 'big beneficiary' of AUKUS, Albanese says",Reuters,2023-03-11 05:21:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/BDP6FIEPTVOX3CVELZ5ERYPNCA.jpg,"SYDNEY, March 11 (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Saturday that South Australia state would be a ""big beneficiary"" of the landmark AUKUS defence pact, which is expected to see Australia buy up to five U.S. Virginia class nuclear powered submarines.
Reuters, citing four U.S. officials, reported this week that Australia would likely buy the submarines in the 2030s as part of the agreement between Washington, Canberra and London, in what would present a new challenge to China's military build-up.
Albanese's federal government has indicated construction would be in South Australia's capital Adelaide, but state premier Peter Malinauskas said this week he was unclear about the number of orders.
On Saturday, Albanese, when asked how many submarines would be built in Australia as part of AUKUS, said an announcement would be made on Monday.
""This is about jobs, including jobs in manufacturing, and Adelaide in particular will be a big beneficiary of this announcement as will Western Australia,"" he said in a TV broadcast from New Delhi, India, where he is on a visit.

Albanese will leave India later on Saturday and go to the United States to meet U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for talks on AUKUS.
""When you talk about the issue of manufacturing submarines in Australia, that's an absolute priority for us,"" Albanese added.
Adelaide was chosen as the site in 2016 when France won a A$50 billion ($33 billion) deal to build 12 submarines for Australia before Canberra scrapped that in favour of AUKUS, causing outrage in Paris.
AUKUS is expected to be Australia's largest-ever defence project and offers the prospect of jobs in all three countries.
China ""firmly objects"" to AUKUS, its foreign ministry said this month.

Indonesia aims to use its vast nickel reserves to become a regional manufacturing hub for electric vehicle batteries, signing more than a dozen deals worth $15 billion with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn in just three years.
But environmentalists have cautioned against realizing those ambitions through rapacious mining and mineral processing, which they say will irreversibly damage the environment, as evidenced in other parts of the resource-rich country.
""You have to comply with regulations set up by the Indonesian government. If you can't, I will shut down your industry within two months,"" said Luhut Pandjaitan, Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs.

World,/world/europe/,EU to hold joint naval exercises amid growing maritime security threats,Kate Abnett,2023-03-10 13:20:00+00:00,,"BRUSSELS, March 10 (Reuters) - The European Union wants to hold joint naval exercises as part of plans published on Friday to step up its efforts to protect critical infrastructure at sea.
Concerns about threats to Europe's maritime infrastructure were heightened by attacks in September on the Nord Stream pipelines, which left them spewing natural gas into the Baltic Sea.
The EU has updated its maritime security strategy, outlining plans to hold an annual naval exercise from 2024 and coordinate member countries' national efforts to protect gas pipelines, undersea data cables, offshore wind farms and other critical maritime infrastructure.
EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius told Reuters that planning had been under way before the Nord Stream blasts, but had been strengthened in response to them.
""After that, member states were very clear that we need to further strengthen cooperation, build capacity, ensure that our critical infrastructure is better protected,"" he said.
The EU plan sets out to increase cooperation between the EU and NATO, expand coastal patrols and improve efforts to identify threats early - such as by using EU satellite programmes to detect unidentified vessels.
View 2 more stories 
The EU will also produce a risk assessment, disaster recovery plans and regional surveillance plans, according to the strategy.
""The threat level is increasing,"" Sinkevicius said.
Energy infrastructure is a particular concern, as Europe expands its offshore wind farms and its use of liquefied natural gas terminals to replace Russian pipeline gas.
The Netherlands said a Russian ship detected at an offshore wind farm in the North Sea last month was part of attempts by Moscow to gain intelligence to sabotage infrastructure.
Improved surveillance of maritime areas should also help countries monitor and respond to environmental degradation and the effects of climate change such as sea level rise.
Authorities in Sweden, Germany and Denmark are investigating the blasts on the Nord Stream pipelines, which were constructed to supply Russian gas to Europe. They have said the explosions were deliberate but have not said who might be responsible.

World,/world/us/,"California copes with heavy rain, flooding in latest 'atmospheric river' storm",Steve Gorman,2023-03-14 11:43:00+00:00,,"LOS ANGELES, March 10 (Reuters) - Emergency officials in several California counties spent Friday patrolling levies and swollen rivers as an ""atmospheric river"" storm drenched the already-sodden state with torrential rains, causing floods that washed out roads and prompted evacuations.
The latest deluge from dense streams of Pacific moisture sweeping California's skies soaked some mountain areas still clogged with piles of snow dumped by a recent spate of paralyzing blizzards, while bringing even more snow to higher elevations.
The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said it was investigating what role, if any, late-February snowstorms may have played in the demise of at least eight people, most of them elderly, found to have died alone while snowbound in their homes over the past two weeks.
Residents in the town of Big Bear and nearby mountain enclaves have said their communities were ill-prepared for the severity of winter storms that local authorities called unprecedented for Southern California's high country.
View 2 more stories 
The latest blast of heavy showers and gusty winds arrived Thursday night and peaked early Friday, sweeping a vast region that is home to some 26 million people, including greater Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and metropolitan Sacramento.
Flood watches and advisories extended from San Diego and Mexican border to the Shasta-Cascade region of northern California.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported rainfall totals ranging from 3 inches to nearly 10 inches across the region.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday declared an emergency in California, ordering federal assistance to help state and local authorities cope with the severe weather.
The storm was the product of what meteorologists call an atmospheric river, a high-altitude current of dense, subtropical moisture streaming into the West Coast from the warm Pacific waters around Hawaii.
It marks the 10th such weather system to hit California since Christmas, adding to an exceptionally wet, snowy winter in a state that in recent years has been plagued far more by drought and wildfires than by severe precipitation.
Among areas hardest hit on Friday were riverfront communities in central California where numerous streams engorged by runoff of rain and melting snow from surrounding mountains were transformed into raging torrents.

About 2,000 residents were under evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo County, as crews there spent the day monitoring levees, creeks and rivers and filling sandbags, said Rachel Monte Dion, the county's emergency services coordinator.
Some personnel spent hours in trailers watching for flooding in low-lying areas across the county, which was pummeled by heavy downpours in January, causing a levy to fail and damaging homes.
""Since January, it's been raining steadily here and so our ground is fully saturated and our creeks are full,"" Dion said, adding that flooding on Friday struck parts of the coastal wine country town of Cambria and the beachfront community of Oceano.
The collapse of one roadway in Paso Robles for the second time since January left a couple hundred residents outside that town cut off again, Dion said.
In Santa Cruz County, another road washed out by a flooded creek near the town of Soquel left at least 400 homes in adjacent foothill and mountain communities isolated, county spokesperson Jason Hoppin said.
Elsewhere in the county, communities along the swiftly rising San Lorenzo River were ordered evacuated before it reached flood stage, then receded, Hoppin said. Authorities were still keeping their eye on the Pajaro River, which drains a much larger area and thus takes longer to rise and fall, he said.
Evacuation orders were issued along the Monterey County banks of that river, where ""the levee is a little bit lower"" than on the Santa Cruz County side, Hoppin said.
On Friday morning, the weather service issued a flash-flood warning for parts of Tulare County, urging residents: ""Move to higher ground now! This is an extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation.""
The Tulare County sheriff has issued evacuation orders and warnings for several areas where rivers and streams had either overrun their banks, were nearing dangerously high levels or where a levee was breached. At least one bridge was reported washed out.
The growing frequency and intensity of such storms amid bouts of prolonged drought are symptomatic of human-caused climate change, experts say. The swing from one extreme to another has increased the difficulty of managing California's precious water supplies while minimizing flood and wildfire risks.

World,/world/uk/,Dealers see UK gilt issuance around 232 billion pounds in 2023/24: Reuters poll,Andy Bruce,2023-03-14 09:29:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PF6JLK3GTFIZ3O5VRQ72JA2UEM.jpg,"MANCHESTER, England, March 14 (Reuters) - Dealers expect Britain to ramp up issuance of government bonds in the coming financial year, although by less than suggested by Debt Management Office (DMO) forecasts published in November, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.
Finance minister Jeremy Hunt looks set to keep his grip on public finances in Wednesday's budget, holding off on any big tax cuts or spending increases until the next election comes closer into view.
The median forecast among banks that can bid directly at government bond auctions - known as gilt-edged market makers (GEMMs) - saw gilt issuance in 2023/24 at 231.9 billion pounds ($282 billion), up from the 169.5 billion pounds 2022/23 remit.
While that would be the second-largest gilt sale remit on record after the coronavirus-hit 2020/21 financial year, it would still be less than the 238 billion pounds that the dealers forecast before Hunt's previous fiscal update in November.

""To be sure, the size of the issuance envelope will be historically high. But the good news is that it's likely to be a lot lower than many, including us, feared late last year,"" said Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank.
Thanks to falling energy prices and stronger-than-expected tax receipts, Tuesday's poll suggested the DMO will announce a gross financing requirement estimate for 2023/24 that will be about 30 billion pounds less than the 305.1 billion pounds it had pencilled in November.
The gross financing requirement is an estimate of the funds the government needs to raise to plug its budget deficit and roll-over bonds that are due to mature.
It comprises issuance of gilts, Treasury bills and savings products for consumers via National Savings and Investment (NS&I), the government's retail finance arm.
Forecasts in the poll for gilt issuance ranged from 166.5 billion pounds to 260 billion pounds, reflecting uncertainty around how the government intends to raise funds in 2023/24.
Some forecasters thought issuance of T-bills and via NS&I would shoulder more of the financing requirement, therefore creating less gilt issuance.
Overall the survey pointed to a median 19 billion pounds in additional net T-bill issuance and 12.5 billion pounds from additional NS&I fundraising.

World,/world/china/,China to fully reopen borders to foreigners but near-term hurdles remain,Joe Cash,2023-03-14 06:14:00+00:00,,"BEIJING, March 14 (Reuters) - China will reopen its borders to foreign tourists for the first time in the three years since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted by allowing all categories of visas to be issued from Wednesday.
The removal of this last cross-border control measure imposed to guard against COVID-19 comes after authorities last month declared victory over the virus.
Tourist industry insiders do not expect a massive influx of visitors in the short run or significant boost to the economy. In 2019, international tourism receipts accounted for just 0.9% of China's gross domestic product.
But the resumption of visa issuance for tourist marks a broader push by Beijing to normalise two-way travel between China and the world, having withdrawn its advisory to citizens against foreign travel in January.
Areas in China that required no visas before the pandemic will revert to visa-free entry, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday. This will include the southern tourist island of Hainan, a long-time favourite destination among Russians, as well as cruise ships passing through Shanghai port.

Visa-free entry for foreigners from Hong Kong and Macau to China's most prosperous province, Guangdong, will also resume, a boon particularly to high-end hotels popular among international business travellers.
""The announcement that China will resume issuing nearly all type of visas for foreigners from tomorrow is positive for Australian businesses whose executives would like to travel to here to visit their China-based teams, customers and suppliers and to explore new business opportunities in the mainland market,"" said Vaughn Barber, chairman of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in China.
Chinese events open to foreign visitors - such as the China Development Forum in Beijing later this month and the Shanghai Autoshow in April - are gradually resuming. The once-every-four-years Asian Games will also take place in the eastern city of Hangzhou in September after being postponed last year due to China's COVID concerns.
But prospective visitors might not immediately arrive in droves.
Unfavourable views of China among western democracies have hardened due to concerns over human rights and Beijing's aggressive foreign policy, as well as suspicions surrounding handling of COVID-19, a global survey by the Pew Research Center in September showed.
""In terms of tourism, China is no longer a hotspot destination,"" said an executive at China International Travel Services in Beijing, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""Commercially, the wish of foreigners to run events in China also decreased after COVID, because too many things here are impacted by politics which has scared them off.""
In a further relaxation of controls on outbound tourism, China added another 40 countries to its list for which group tours are allowed, bringing the total number of countries to 60.
But the list still excludes Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States. Ties between those countries deepened as Washington faced off with Beijing over issues from Russia and Ukraine to Chinese military presence in the South China Sea.
""It's common to use tourist visas to come to China on business, but I don't know how enthusiastic institutional investors will be to do so, after all the drumbeat of scary news,"" said Duncan Clark, founder of BDA, a Beijing-based investment consultancy.
In 2022, just 115.7 million cross-border trips were made in and out of China, with foreigners accounting for around 4.5 million.
By contrast, China logged 670 million overall trips in 2019 before the arrival of COVID, with foreigners accounting for 97.7 million.

World,/world/africa/,Egypt withholding identity papers from dissidents abroad- rights group,Reuters,2023-03-13 09:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/TJLGPZSOZVIDXPDZ3FIAUQG2UU.jpg,"CAIRO, March 13 (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities have been systematically refusing to provide or renew identity documents to dissidents, journalists and activists abroad in a crackdown on opposition that extends beyond Egypt's borders, Human Rights Watch said on Monday.
The U.S.-based group said it had interviewed 26 Egyptians living in countries including Turkey, Germany, Malaysia and Qatar last year, and had reviewed documents relating to nine of them.
Egypt's state press centre and foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
""By arbitrarily depriving its citizens abroad from obtaining valid passports and other identity documents, the Egyptian authorities are violating both the constitution and international human rights law,"" HRW said.
In Turkey, home to a large number of Egyptian opposition figures, Egypt's consulate requires applicants for almost all services to fill out unofficial forms with private details including the reasons they left Egypt and links to social media accounts, HRW said.

Those interviewed said it was ""nearly impossible"" to challenge refusals to provide documents, it added.
Egyptian authorities have conducted a far-reaching crackdown on political dissent under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power after leading the overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi in 2013.
Rights groups say tens of thousands, including Islamists and liberals, have been arrested and that the state has also targeted dissidents who moved abroad and in some cases their relatives still in Egypt.
Sisi and his supporters say the crackdown was needed to stabilise Egypt, denying that charges against dissidents are politically motivated and asserting that the judiciary acts independently.
Earlier this month, a state security court handed lengthy prison sentences to more than 20 people including rights defenders on terrorism-related charges, in a mass trial denounced by activists as unjust.
U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Turk said last week that the sentences had been issued ""in proceedings on questionable terrorism-related charges which also raised fair trial concerns"".

World,/world/uk/,UK PM Sunak rules out law change for return of Parthenon marbles,Reuters,2023-03-13 07:06:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VCBPIZZ6QJJ65L47LZANJ7KOZI.jpg,"SAN DIEGO, March 13 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ruled out changing a law which prohibits the British Museum handing the Parthenon marbles permanently back to Greece.
Sunak said there are no plans to amend the legislation, which states the museum can only dispose of objects within its collection in limited circumstances. However, the museum could still arrange a loan of the sculptures.
Since independence in 1832, Greece has repeatedly called for the return of the sculptures - known in Britain as the Elgin Marbles - that British diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th century, when Greece was under Ottoman rule.
Sunak is unlikely to break with the stances of his two predecessors who were both against any kind of loan of the marbles to Greece.
""The UK has cared for the Elgin Marbles for generations. Our galleries and museums are funded by taxpayers because they are a huge asset to this country,"" Sunak told reporters on his plane as he flew to the United States.
""We share their treasures with the world, and the world comes to the UK to see them. The collection of the British Museum is protected by law, and we have no plans to change it.""

The former finance minister George Osborne, the chair of the British Museum, has been working on a new arrangement with Greece through which the sculptures could be seen both in London and in Athens.
The Parthenon Project, which has been backed by British politicians from different political parties to settle the issue, said on Sunday the British Museum's Parthenon collection could be returned to Greece under a long-term cultural partnership agreement.

During the protests against a ""foreign agents"" law that critics said signalled an authoritarian shift in Georgia, Zelenskiy thanked protesters for waving Ukrainian flags, saying it showed respect, and he wished Georgians ""democratic success"".
Last Friday, Georgia's parliament dropped the bill, which had threatened to harm Tbilisi's bid for closer ties with Europe. Critics had said it was inspired by a 2012 Russian law that has been used widely to crack down on dissent in Russia.
""When a person who is at war... responds to the destructive action of several thousand people here in Georgia, this is direct evidence that this person is involved, motivated to make something happen here too, to change,"" Garibashvili said in an interview with the Georgian IMEDI television broadcast on Sunday, referring to Zelenskiy.

""I want to wish everyone a timely end to this war, and peace,"" Garibashvili added.
However, Ukraine's foreign ministry spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko accused Garibashvili of repeating ""Russian propaganda"" by suggesting that Kyiv sought to draw Georgia into its conflict with Moscow.
""We categorically reject such claims, which have nothing to do with reality. The Georgian authorities are looking for an enemy in the wrong place,"" Nikolenko said on Facebook on Monday.
""Ukraine has been and will remain a friend of the Georgian people, whom we do not wish to stop (in their task of) building a European future.""
Despite Garibashvili's comments, Georgian public opinion is strongly pro-Ukrainian and anti-Russian. Georgia fought its own brief war with Russia in 2008 over the status of two Moscow-backed breakaway regions, Azkhazia and South Ossetia.
Georgia and Ukraine both aspire to join the European Union one day.

Treasury said 99% of the $350 billion of ARP money set aside for state and local authorities and Tribal governments has been delivered, and states have already budgeted for 90% of those funds, although funds may flow out over time.
New Treasury data through the end of December show that $24.3 billion has been budgeted for 7,000 big infrastructure initiatives in broadband, water and sewer, expanding high-speed internet access for over 1.4 million families and businesses, with nearly $16 billion budgeted for 2,100 housing projects.
Additional budget plans by states and local governments include $12 billion for 5,300 public health projects and $11 billion more for 3,500 workforce development projects training workers for new, higher-paying jobs, Treasury said.

Biden's COVID relief package passed without any Republican votes, raising the prospect that Republican-controlled states and local governments could refuse to participate, as they did with Medicaid funds under former President Barack Obama.
But Treasury data show both Democratic- and Republican-controlled states and local governments have tapped ARP funds to provide pandemic relief and invest in projects with long-term impact, such as boosting access to high-speed Internet.
Wyoming's Republican Governor Mark Gordon last month announced his statement had been awarded $70.5 million in ARP funds to build broadband infrastructure in locations that lack access to adequate service, bringing high-speed internet to an estimated 11,700 Wyoming homes and businesses.

World,/world/europe/,"Russia, Ukraine battle for Bakhmut; Moscow says grain deal extended",Mike Collett-White,2023-03-14 09:14:00+00:00,,"NEAR KREMINNA, Ukraine, March 14 (Reuters) - Ukraine's future hinges on the outcome of battles in the east, including in and around Bakhmut, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said, with both sides describing brutal fighting as Russia intensifies a winter campaign to capture the small city.
Bakhmut has become the focus of Russia's invasion, with the months-long fight becoming Europe's bloodiest infantry battle since World War Two.
""It is very tough in the east - very painful,"" Zelenskiy said in his overnight video address, held nightly since Russia launched its invasion more than a year ago.
""We have to destroy the enemy's military power. And we shall destroy it.""
Kyiv and Moscow gave differing accounts of negotiations to extend the Black Sea grain deal, established last year to prevent global famine by securing wartime exports from Ukraine and Russia, both among the world's top suppliers of food.
The arrangement, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey, is due to expire this week. Russia said it had been extended for 60 days, but Ukraine said the agreement required any extension to last 120 days. Turkey said talks were still ongoing.

In what would be the first international war crimes cases arising from the invasion, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is expected to seek the arrest of Russian officials for forcibly deporting children from Ukraine and targeting civilian infrastructure, a source told Reuters.
The Kremlin said the court has no jurisdiction over Russia.
Moscow would be certain to reject arrest warrants against its officials, but an international war crimes prosecution could deepen its diplomatic isolation over a campaign that has killed thousands of civilians and driven millions from their homes.
On the battlefront, Ukrainian soldiers said on Monday they were repelling attacks near Kreminna, north of Bakhmut.
In a forest some 8 km (5 miles) from the front, cannons boomed and explosions rumbled constantly in the distance.
A soldier was brought from the front with a wounded leg. He was stabilised in a van with a splint and painkillers before being taken to a medical centre.
""We stabilise the patient as much as possible,"" medic Mykhailo Anest, 35, said as a huge explosion rang out. ""This means bandaging, inspecting tourniquets if any were applied, giving pain killers, treating infections, giving infusions... We do all of this so that once our patient arrives at the stabilisation point, he is as stable as possible.""
On the other side of the front in Volnovakha, a Russian-controlled village to the south, the body of a woman lay on a street next to a ruined shop. A Russian military investigator told Reuters the area had been struck by Ukrainian shelling.

Trench warfare, described by both sides as a meat grinder, has claimed a huge toll in Bakhmut, with both sides reporting hundreds of enemy troops killed each day. Neither side gives regular figures of its own casualties.
Russia says taking Bakhmut would open a path to capture all of surrounding Donetsk province, a central war aim. Ukraine, which has decided to defend Bakhmut rather than withdraw, says wearing out Russia's military there now will help its counter-offensive later.
Britain's Ministry of Defence said on Tuesday that Moscow was running short of ammunition, ""to the extent that extremely punitive shell-rationing is in force on many parts of the front"".
""This has almost certainly been a key reason why no Russian formation has recently been able to generate operationally significant offensive action,"" it said in a daily intelligence update.
But not every military analyst is convinced that defending Bakhmut is the best strategy for Ukraine.
Ukraine was suffering losses among reserves it intended to use for a later push against Russian forces, Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said in an interview. ""We could lose here everything we wanted to use for those counter-offensives.""
Russia launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 last year saying it had to demilitarise Ukraine to respond to a security threat. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext to subdue the country. Moscow now claims to have annexed a fifth of Ukraine.
The ICC, which opened an investigation into war crimes in Ukraine last year, is expected to seek its first warrants against Russian officials ""in the short term"", a source with knowledge of the matter said.
It was unclear which Russian officials the prosecutor might seek warrants against or when they might be issued. Charges could include the crime of genocide, the source said.
The ICC prosecutor's office declined to comment.
""The ICC is an instrument of neo-colonialism in the hands of the West,"" said Konstantin Kosachyov, deputy speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament.
Russia has pushed back against previous accusations that it had forcibly moved Ukrainians. It says it has taken Ukrainian children to Russia as a humanitarian effort to protect orphans and children abandoned in the conflict.
Ukraine says thousands of deported children are being housed in camps or adopted into Russian families, given Russian passports and brought up to reject Ukrainian nationality.
The U.N. genocide convention defines ""forcibly transferring children of the group to another group"" as one of five acts that can be prosecuted as genocide.

World,/world/americas/,"IMF staff OK Argentina loan review, say targets could be eased",Jorgelina Do Rosario,2023-03-13 23:06:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZLW4VR5SMJI5NCCZAS2ACJL4PA.jpg,"LONDON/NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Argentina reached a staff-level agreement on the fourth review of their $44 billion loan program, the IMF said in a statement on Monday, confirming that some economic targets for the country could be eased.
The IMF staff said that adjustments were being requested to key targets to build up foreign currency reserves, which has been hampered by a major drought gripping the grains producing nation that has hurt exports of soy, corn and wheat.
It said adjustments would be focused on early 2023 and would help adapt the program for the ""impact of the increasingly severe drought"", while also taking into account plans by the country to save dollars by cutting spending on energy imports.
Argentina, the world's biggest exporter of soymeal and soyoil and the No. 3 for corn, is facing the worst drought in at least six decades, combined with repeated heat waves.
View 2 more stories 
The IMF said that the country would need to strengthen its policy package in the face of the drought to ensure stability, rein in annual inflation running near 100% and address what it called ""recent policy setbacks"".
Reuters previously reported that Argentina was looking to lower the bar on the reserves targets agreed with the IMF, including by linking the targets to its exports.
""The IMF is acknowledging that the macroeconomic backdrop has become more challenging, especially considering the severe drought,"" said Gordian Kemen, a New York-based head of EM sovereign strategy at Standard Chartered.
Even so, he said, it was unclear how Argentina would be able to ""re-accelerate reserve accumulation later"", especially with pressure to spend ahead of elections slated for October.
Argentina's net reserves stood at around $4.2 billion at the end of February, according to calculations from Buenos Aires-based firm FMyA.
The review is now pending board approval, after which some $5.3 billion would be made available to Argentina.
The current loan arrangement was worth $44 billion when it was agreed in early 2022 to replace a failed $57 billion program from 2018. Most of the cash would be used to pay the fund back.
Argentina surprisingly announced in January a debt buyback despite depleted hard currency reserves - a move that Moody's considered a default, while S&P and Fitch did not.
A top IMF official later said the fund would ""prefer not to have actions that undermine the reserve accumulation that we're assuming in the program.""

World,/world/uk/,SVB shock could have chilling effect on British biotech sector,Natalie Grover,2023-03-13 19:18:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/I6JSJDT22FLA5NZEP5VHVUFKHI.jpg,"LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - HSBC (HSBA.L)'s rescue of the British arm of Silicon Valley Bank saved the heavily-exposed UK biotech sector from collapse, but the fallout could hamper funding in a sector the government sees as key to future economic growth, industry executives said.
The move brought an end to frantic weekend talks between the British government, regulators, and prospective buyers, as the survival of many biotech start-ups hung in the balance and U.S. and European authorities sought to stem contagion to the broader financial sector.
About 40% of the UK's biotech companies, developing drugs for everything from cancer to heart disease, were banking with Silicon Valley Bank's (SVB) British arm, according to the UK BioIndustry Association (BIA).
""This was absolutely crucial for our sector and companies would be going down this morning if there wasn't a solution. On Friday, it was despair. This morning it was elation,"" said Steve Bates, head of BIA, which represents over 500 companies in the life sciences sector.
View 2 more stories 
Given the time and money required to develop a drug, early-stage biotech firms often operate for years without revenue and depend on start-up friendly banks like SVB for lines of credit to continue their research and development.
SVB UK has loans of around 5.5 billion pounds ($6.66 billion), deposits of about 6.7 billion pounds and about 3,000 UK clients, according to HSBC.
Around 16 tech and life sciences companies in Europe have disclosed about $190 million in exposure to SVB in the United Kingdom and the United States. UK-based companies, including Diaceutics (DXRX.L), Ourgene Health Plc (YGEN.L) and Windward Ltd (WNWD.L) have said they have exposure to the bank's UK arm.
Adrian Rawcliffe, CEO of Adaptimmune Therapeutics, a NASDAQ-listed but British-headquartered cancer company, suggested that ""for smaller private start-ups, SVB was one of the few banks who really understood the risk profile of early stage, venture-backed biotech companies"".
Dima Kuzmin, managing partner of London-based investment firm 4BIO Capital, which does not bank with SVB directly but has portfolio companies exposed to the bank, said many entrepreneurs and CEOs of small start-ups had also opened personal accounts with SVB.
""Several CEOs I know and work with have had all of their personal cash with the bank - like literally all of it - because this was their main bank. So you can imagine the scale of anxiety,"" Kuzmin said.
He said following the sector-saving buyout by HSBC, ""concern remains over the potential systemic effects"".
Worst case, he said, investors will become more concerned about liquidity in the sector and start drip-feeding the biotechs with smaller funding rounds.
The turmoil follows a difficult year for biotech funding globally. Rising interest rates, recession fears and geopolitical shockwaves saw investors pull back from anything considered risky last year.
In the biotech sector globally, there were only 47 initial public offerings (IPOs) last year that raised about $4 billion in total, compared with 152 offerings in 2021 that had raised over $25 billion.
""And then in 2023, as the market was starting to come back, a shock like this has a chilling effect on the amount of money that would otherwise go into developing new medicines,"" said James Peyer, CEO of U.S.-based Cambrian Biopharma.
The SVB collapse also comes after the UK's biggest listed drugmakers GSK (GSK.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) warned last month that the UK government's ambition to become a life sciences ""superpower"" has been hampered by a discouraging tax environment among other problems.
Though the country has renowned scientific research centres at Oxford and Cambridge Universities, it has struggled to convert that into a thriving biotech sector attracting the kinds of funds the United States does, experts say.
Coventry-based biotech company NanoSyrinx had 3 to 4 million pounds worth of funds in the UK arm of SVB, and was scrambling on Friday to extract its money, but was unsuccessful in getting a transfer through, founder and CEO Dr. Joe Healey told Reuters.
Ultimately management was reasonably confident that a resolution was going to be found given the government's science superpower agenda meant an intervention was likely, he said.
Going forward, there will likely be more second guessing in the short term for biotech investment in the UK, he added.
""I certainly don't imagine it's going to make securing funds easier for the next couple of years.""

World,/world/asia-pacific/,Australia's nuclear submarine plan to cost up to $245 billion by 2055 -defence official,Lewis Jackson,2023-03-14 12:24:00+00:00,,"CANBERRA, March 14 (Reuters) - Australia's nuclear-powered submarine programme with the United States and Britain will cost up to A$368 billion ($245 billion) over the next three decades, a defence official said on Tuesday, the country's biggest single defence project in history.
U.S. President Joe Biden, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled details of a plan to provide Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines, a major step to counter China's naval build up in the Indo-Pacific.
Albanese said the programme would start with a A$6 billion ($4 billion) investment over the next four years to expand a major submarine base and the country's submarine shipyards, as well as train skilled workers.
""This will be an Australian sovereign capability - built by Australians, commanded by the Royal Australian Navy and sustained by Australian workers in Australian shipyards,"" Albanese said in San Diego, California.
View 2 more stories 
""The scale, complexity and economic significance of the investment is akin to the creation of the Australian automotive industry in the post-war period,"" Albanese added.
Australia will also provide A$3 billion to expand shipbuilding capacity in the U.S. and Britain, with the bulk of the money destined to speed up production of U.S. Virginia-class submarines.
The total cost of the submarine program is estimated to be A$268 billion to A$368 billion by 2055, or roughly 0.15% of gross domestic product per year, a defence official told Reuters.
The price tag involves the cost of building submarines as well as associated infrastructure and training, and the programme would create 20,000 jobs in Australia over three decades.
Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the decision was ""a game-changing investment"" as the government, in the face of mounting pressure on the federal budget and protracted deficits, fielded questions on the price tag.
""Australia can't afford not to do this ... it will be worth every cent when it comes to our national security, our national economy,"" Chalmers told reporters.
Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who was the defence minister when AUKUS was announced in 2021, said he would support the submarine deal ""come hell or high water"".
Britain will build the first SSN-AUKUS boat, as the new class of submarines has been dubbed. The first Australian-built boat will be delivered in 2042, and one will be built every three years until the fleet reaches eight.
Australian submarine construction will occur in the state of South Australia, where A$2 billion will be spent on infrastructure, creating 4,000 jobs, with another 5,500 direct shipyard jobs at the peak of construction. The government said that was double the workforce anticipated for a scrapped plan to build French-designed conventional submarines.
A naval base in Perth will be the home for the new submarine fleet, upgraded at a cost of A$8 billion over a decade and generating 3,000 jobs, documents and statements released by Australia on Tuesday showed.
U.S. nuclear-powered submarines will visit Western Australia more frequently this year, with British submarines making port visits starting in 2026.
From 2027 the Perth base, HMAS Stirling, will be host to a rotational presence of British and U.S. nuclear-powered submarines to build Australia's experience.
The new AUKUS submarine class is being built in Australia and Britain because the planned next model of U.S. submarine is too large for Australia, said John Blaxland, a professor of international security at Australian National University.
He called the massive cost a ""hike in the insurance premium for national security"".
As Australia's historical ties with Britain and the United States are revived, it will also be important to remain engaged with its neighbours in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
""Yes, it’s an eye-watering price tag, but the alternative is an even heavier cost to Australia’s security and sovereignty down the track,"" said Australian Strategic Policy institute executive director Justin Bassi.

Technology,/technology/india-plans-new-security-testing-smartphones-crackdown-pre-installed-apps-2023-03-14/,"Exclusive: India plans new security testing for smartphones, crackdown on pre-installed apps",Munsif Vengattil,2023-03-14 07:54:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/TRF3IM5CTFK7JP6AAIOVFREPQA.jpg,"NEW DELHI, March 14 (Reuters) - India plans to force smartphone makers to allow removal of pre-installed apps and mandate screening of major operating system updates under proposed new security rules, according to two people and a government document seen by Reuters.
The new rules, details of which have not been previously reported, could extend launch timelines in the world's No.2 smartphone market and lead to losses in business from pre-installed apps for players including Samsung (005930.KS), Xiaomi (1810.HK), Vivo, and Apple (AAPL.O).
India's IT ministry is considering these new rules amid concerns about spying and abuse of user data, said a senior government official, one of the two people, declining to be named as the information is not yet public.
""Pre-installed apps can be a weak security point and we want to ensure no foreign nations, including China, are exploiting it. It's a matter of national security,"" the official added.

India has ramped up scrutiny of Chinese businesses since a 2020 border clash between the neighbours, banning more than 300 Chinese apps, including TikTok. It has also intensified scrutiny of investments by Chinese firms.
Globally too, many nations have imposed restrictions on the use of technology from Chinese firms like Huawei (HWT.UL) and Hikvision (002415.SZ) on fears Beijing could use them to spy on foreign citizens. China denies these allegations.
Currently, most smartphones come with pre-installed apps that cannot be deleted, such as Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi's app store GetApps, Samsung's payment app Samsung Pay mini and iPhone maker Apple's browser Safari.
Under the new rules, smartphone makers will have to provide an uninstall option and new models will be checked for compliance by a lab authorized by the Bureau of Indian Standards agency, two people with knowledge of the plan said.
The government is also considering mandating screening of every major operating system update before it is rolled out to consumers, one of the people said.
""Majority of smartphones used in India are having pre-installed Apps/Bloatware which poses serious privacy/information security issue(s),"" stated a Feb. 8 confidential government record of an IT ministry meeting, seen by Reuters.
The closed-door meeting was attended by representatives from Xiaomi, Samsung, Apple and Vivo, the meeting record shows.
The government has decided to give smartphone makers a year to comply once the rule comes into effect, the date for which has not been fixed yet, the document added.
The companies and India's IT ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
India's fast-growing smartphone market is dominated by Chinese players, with Xiaomi and BBK Electronics' Vivo and Oppo accounting for almost half of all sales, Counterpoint data shows. South Korea's Samsung has a 20% share and Apple has 3%.
While European Union regulations require allowing removal of pre-installed apps, it does not have a screening mechanism to check for compliance like India is considering.
An industry executive said some pre-installed apps like the camera are critical to user experience and the government must make a distinction between these and non-essential ones when imposing screening rules.
Smartphone players often sell their devices with proprietary apps, but also sometimes pre-install others with which they have monetisation agreements.
The other worry is more testing could prolong approval timelines for smartphones, a second industry executive said. Currently it takes about 21 weeks for a smartphone and its parts to be tested by the government agency for safety compliance.
""It's a massive hindrance to a company's go-to market strategy,"" the executive said.

Santander (SAN.MC), HSBC (HSBA.L) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) are still willing to connect with crypto firms, CoinDesk said, after recent banking failures in the United States left crypto firms and tech startups stranded and hunting for new banking partners.

""The core is the recovery in consumer's income,"" said CEO Xu Lei, adding a recovery in consumption could take a while.
After a brief rise, the company's U.S.-listed shares turned lower before the market open.
Online direct sales revenue in the quarter grew 1% year on year, missing analysts consensus forecast of 4%, according to a research report by Atlantic Equities after the results.
""The softness was primarily due to weakness in electronics and home appliances as a result of COVID disruption as well as softer property market,"" the report said.
JD.com's net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was 3 billion yuan ($431 million) in the three months ended December, versus a net loss of 5.2 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.1% to 295.4 billion yuan, missing the consensus estimate of 296.2 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.

The battle in China's e-commerce market has been fierce in the past few years, and in 2019 PDD Holdings (PDD.O) launched a discounting campaign called the ""10 billion yuan subsidy"", which was quickly copied by Alibaba Group's (9988.HK) e-commerce platform.
JD.com followed suit this week, as competition grew even more intense with newcomers Douyin, owned by ByteDance, and Tencent-backed Kuaishou (1024.HK).
Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, an e-commerce consulting firm based in Beijing, said the subsidy programme was an aggressive investment aimed at increasing users.
""JD.com's subsidy campaign will attract more users to the platform and boost sales in the short-term,"" he said. ""However, it will hurt JD.com's margins and possibly weaken the platform's image. While PDD markets itself as a budget shopping platform, JD.com has built a strong reputation among first-tier city consumers as a marketplace for higher-end goods.""
China Merchants Securities also said in a recent report that the subsidy programme was likely to lead to margin erosion.
Parts of China remained under strict lockdown for most of the December quarter, with shoppers holding back on spending amid continued economic uncertainty.
On an adjusted basis, JD.com earned 4.81 yuan per American depositary share in the quarter, compared with 2.21 yuan per share a year earlier.
The Beijing-based company said in January it was winding down its e-commerce business in Indonesia and Thailand, where it faced stiff competition from Sea Ltd-owned (SE.N) Shopee.
Last month, peer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (9988.HK) reported higher-than-expected revenue in the December quarter.

""Ford will work constructively with its union partners to reduce the impact of the separations on employees, their families, and the local community,"" she said.
The company has decided to stop assembling Galaxy minivans and S-Max station wagon-like cars in Valencia.
Last year, Ford had said it was delaying production investments in Spain, citing a ""revised outlook for Europe"", but said it would stick with a plan to start producing electric vehicles later this decade at its Spanish factory.
The electric vehicle production plan would entail job cuts, Ford had said when unveiling the project.

The dry process, which Tesla obtained via its 2019 acquisition of California startup Maxwell Technologies, replaces a traditional, complicated step of battery manufacturing that involves coating the electrode foil with a wet, chemical slurry.
The coated foil needs to go through a lengthy drying process before final assembly, and the toxic solvents used in the slurry need to be recovered and disposed of.
The electric vehicle maker has said the dry coating process has the potential to dramatically reduce the size, cost, energy consumption and production cycle time of battery manufacturing plants, while boosting the energy density and power of battery cells.
Besides Maxwell, other companies working on dry coating include California-based LiCap Technologies and Massachusetts-based AM Batteries.

Warner flew back to Australia from India last month after suffering a fractured elbow and a head injury in the second test of the four-match series, which the hosts won 2-1.
Apart from a defiant 200 against South Africa in December, the 36-year-old has struggled in recent tests and there has been speculation in Australian media that he might retire after the WTC final, which starts on June 7 at The Oval.
""I think you work through that conversation, and how each player finishes is always different,"" McDonald said of Warner. ""Some want to go out in a certain way, and others are OK with potentially being dropped out of sides.
""But at the moment Dave's fully in our plans for the WTC final, he's coming back for the one-day series (against India), he's recovered from his injury, so we'll see Dave back in Australian colours on March 17 and we'll go from there.""

""Who could have imagined that one day, this exhibition, which was in a basement, could be displayed in Olaya (downtown Riyadh)?"" said Keneibit, 60, who is blazing a trail for women in the arts in Saudi Arabia's conservative male-dominated society.

Some say the prohibition was also because of the pagan deities that Arabs worshipped in the pre-Islamic era.
As a result, human sculptures became largely absent from public spheres in the Arabian Peninsula since Prophet Mohammed was said to have destroyed idols in and around the sacred Kaaba site in Mecca in 630 AD.

However, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has curbed the influence of Wahhabism on Saudi society and arts, also reining in the religious police and letting women drive cars.
Despite that, human rights groups say abuses prevail due to his crackdown on dissent and tight grip on power.
U.S.-educated Keneibit said she resorted to creating a private gallery at the bottom of her house for friends and guests after a public exhibition was banned in 2009.
Her work is now welcomed in Riyadh's most prestigious galleries, where other fellow Saudi artists have in the last few years also began enjoying their new-found freedoms.

Britain's Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer last week wrote a letter to 13 of the biggest Olympic sponsors, urging them to put pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to abandon its proposal.
""It is not up to governments to decide which athletes can participate in which international competitions. This would be the end of world sport as we know it today,"" the IOC said on Monday.
""We hope very much that the British government will respect the autonomy of sport ...
""It must be the sole responsibility of sports organisations to decide which athletes can take part in international competitions based exclusively on their sporting merit.

""In accordance with this, Olympic sponsors are not involved in this decision-making process.""
The IOC issued sanctions against Russia and Belarus after last year's invasion of Ukraine but is reluctant to exclude their athletes from the Olympics entirely for fear of a return to the boycotts of the Cold War era.
They set out a pathway in January for competitors from Russia and its ally Belarus to earn Olympic slots through Asian qualifying and to compete as neutral athletes in Paris.
Neutral athletes are not considered to be representing their nations and their successes are not accompanied by the flying of flags or playing of national anthems.
The British government issued a joint statement last month with 34 other nations reiterating a call on the IOC to issue a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes from its competitions.
Ukraine has threatened to boycott the Paris Olympics if athletes from Russia and Belarus compete.

Top seed Swiatek has been in superb form on hardcourts since the Australian Open, capturing the Doha title and reaching the final in Dubai, and the Polish player looked set for another comfortable win after cruising through the opening set.
The reigning U.S. Open champion found herself in trouble at 2-4 in the next set but battled back to close out the match in the tiebreak.

It was a disappointing day for Leylah Fernandez, who Raducanu beat in the final two years ago, as the Canadian fell 6-4 6-7 (5) 6-1 to fifth seed Caroline Garcia.
Even though the match required three sets and nearly two-and-a-half hours to determine a winner the fifth seeded Garcia was rarely under pressure from her opponent, who managed just two break chances and could not convert either.
Australian Open winner Aryna Sabalenka will take on Dubai champion Barbora Krejcikova on Tuesday after advancing to the fourth round when her Ukrainian opponent Lesia Tsurenko withdrew due to a panic attack.
Tsurenko said her panic attack was triggered following a conversation with WTA chief executive Steve Simon about tennis's response to Russia's invasion of her country.
On the men's side of the draw, defending champion and fourth seed Taylor Fritz steamrolled into the fourth round with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of Sebastian Baez.
Fritz kept the 35th ranked Argentine under constant pressure throughout breaking him six times to set up a round of 16 meeting with Hungary's Marton Fucsovics.
It was the end of the road for Andy Murray, who lost 7-6(6) 6-2 to fellow Briton Jack Draper.

""We aim to challenge the current perceptions of the governing bodies, to reach a point where they accept the connection between repetitive blows to the head and permanent neurological injury and to take steps to protect players and support those who are injured.""
The lack of protection against repetitive concussive and sub-concussive blows, the law firm said, has led to irreversible neurological impairments, including early onset dementia, CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), post-concussion syndrome, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease.

""(CTE) is a cruel and progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in many players of contact sports leading to repetitive brain trauma,"" they said.
Rylands Garth applauded Monday's news that World Rugby is recommending that the tackle height be lowered to below the sternum in the amateur game, following a similar move by the RFU, albeit one that has had to be quickly reappraised after widespread criticism of their failure to consult almost anyone about the plan.
World Rugby pointed to studies in France and South Africa that showed positive advancements in terms of player safety and overall game experience.
""However, it is too little, too late for our clients and many thousands of others to have played the game,"" the law firm said.
Among the allegations are a failure by defendants to educate and warn about the risks of permanent brain injury, reduce the amount of contact allowed in training and reduce the number of matches in a season.
Rylands Garth represents over 250 Rugby Union players with brain damage in total, including England World Cup winner Steve Thompson and former Wales captain Ryan Jones, as well as 100 Rugby League players, as part of a separate but similar potential claim against the RFL.
Claimants range from in their 20s through to their 70s.
""Several players we represent have, sadly, died from their brain injuries,"" the firm said.
Worrying symptoms in numerous cases from both rugby union and league, they added, include chronic depression, aggression, significant memory loss, incontinence, drug and alcohol addiction, and in some cases suicide attempts.
In a joint statement in 2022, World Rugby, the RFU and WRU said: ""We care deeply about all our players, and never stand still when it comes to welfare. Our strategies to prevent, identify and manage head injuries are driven by a passion to safeguard our players and founded on the latest science, evidence and independent expert guidance.""
The sport has been wrestling with the issue of concussion for several years with the focus in the professional game being on trying to reduce head-to-head and shoulder-to-head contact, which invariably now attracts a yellow or red card for the offender.
The issue of repetitive head trauma has exploded in numerous sports in recent years. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the National Football League's estimated $1 billion settlement of concussion-related lawsuits with more than 4,500 former players, one of the largest lawsuits in U.S. history.
In 2019, the NHL paid $18.49 million to settle a concussion lawsuit brought by more than 100 players.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/sports/,"Berhalter cleared by U.S. Soccer investigation, remains candidate for coaching job",Reuters,2023-03-13 21:03:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/OA5FPTNMBVJZ7NWEPPHACCRAZ4.jpg,"March 13 (Reuters) - An investigation into former U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter's dispute with his wife outside a bar in 1992 concluded that U.S. Soccer was not in the wrong for hiring him as the national team coach, the federation said on Monday.
The investigators' conclusions mean there is now no legal impediment to employing Berhalter, who remains a candidate for the coaching job which is now held by Anthony Hudson on an interim basis.
The investigation came about after Berhalter criticised U.S. midfielder Gio Reyna, who he said had not met expectations at the World Cup in Qatar, with Reyna's mother Danielle informing the federation of the 1992 incident.
Danielle and Berhalter's wife Rosalind were previously college room mates and soccer team mates.
Berhalter has said he regrets kicking his wife of 25 years in the legs during the dispute and that they ultimately reconciled and learned from the incident.
View 2 more stories 
""Based on the facts obtained throughout the investigation, the legal analysis conducted by Alston & Bird leads us to conclude that the fact of the 1992 incident does not prevent an employer from employing Mr Berhalter,"" the report said.
""Given that the 1992 incident occurred approximately 31 years ago and given the lack of information or any evidence contradicting witness accounts or suggesting any similar conduct after that incident, there is no basis to conclude that employing Mr Berhalter would create legal risks for an organization.""
The investigators said they were impressed with Berhalter's ""candor and demeanor"" during the investigation and that he had cooperated fully and extensively.
However, they said they were ""less impressed"" with the Reynas' cooperation.
""After several attempts to schedule an interview, we had two brief phone conversations with Mrs Reyna on December 29th, and we did not succeed in having a follow-up conversation with her –or any conversation with Mr. Reyna – after that,"" it said.
""Mrs. Reyna's story evolved over the course of the investigation.""
U.S. Soccer sporting director Earnie Stewart had also decided to vacate his position amid an ongoing shakeup at the organization, which said interviews were underway to hire his replacement.
""The Sporting Director will lead the process of determining who will serve as head coach of the Men's National Team,"" U.S. Soccer said.
""Given the investigators' conclusion that there is no legal impediment to employing him, Gregg Berhalter remains a candidate to serve as head coach of the Men's National Team.""

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/science/,SpaceX capsule returns crew of four from space station mission,Reuters,2023-03-12 04:14:00+00:00,,"WASHINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - Four crew members aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule splashed down off Florida's Gulf coast on Saturday, returning safely from a five-month science mission on the International Space Station.
The SpaceX capsule, dubbed Endurance, parachuted into waters off the coast of Tampa just after 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT) carrying two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut after a roughly nine-hour flight from the orbital research lab, a NASA-SpaceX webcast showed.
The Crew-5 team launched from Florida on Oct. 6 to conduct routine science aboard the station. It included cosmonaut Anna Kikina, 38, who became the first Russian to fly on an American spacecraft in 20 years, and NASA flight commander Nicole Aunapu Mann, 45, the first Native American woman sent into orbit.
NASA pilot Josh Cassada, 49, and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, 59, a veteran of four previous spaceflights, were also aboard.

The Crew Dragon spacecraft, a gumdrop-shaped pod designed to launch atop SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, undocked from the space station early on Saturday morning and re-entered Earth's atmosphere around 8:11 p.m. EST (0111 GMT Sunday), enduring frictional heat that sent temperatures outside the capsule soaring to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,930 degrees Celsius).
Two sets of parachutes deployed to brake the capsule's descent to 15 miles per hour (24 kilometers per hour) just before splashdown.
The mission was SpaceX's sixth crewed flight for NASA since its Crew Dragon spacecraft first flew humans in May 2020, when it restored crewed launches from American soil after nearly a decade of U.S. dependence on Russia's Soyuz program for space station flights.
Kikina, the only woman in Russia's cosmonaut corps, was the first Russian to fly on an American spacecraft under a renewed agreement signed in 2022 between NASA and Russia's space agency to conduct joint flights. NASA astronaut Frank Rubio, currently on the station, launched there on a Soyuz rocket in September.

There were ecstatic roars and fist-pumps as her triumph was announced at an Oscars viewing party in Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, with all eyes on her surprised and delighted mother, Janet Yeoh.
""She's a very hardworking girl, you know. Everybody knows it,"" she told a news conference afterwards, in front of a poster of her daughter that said ""Pride of Malaysia"".
The actress's niece, Vicki Yeoh, looked equally stunned as the announcement was made, clutching her face and letting out a huge scream as the tears welled up.
""Jaw dropping moment ... I was speechless I cried, it happened so quickly and we are so happy that she won, that our auntie won,"" she said.
Yeoh, 60, won the award for her portrayal of a Chinese American laundromat owner Evelyn Wang, dealing with family turmoil in the science-fiction kung fu comedy ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"".

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim lauded Yeoh's success and said her career was illustrious and exemplary and would continue to inspire Malaysians.
""In creating history by being not just the first Malaysian but the very first Asian actress to win in this category, we take enormous pride in her achievement, adding to a long list of successes and capping a critically acclaimed acting career spanning decades,"" Anwar said in a statement on his Facebook page.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/sports/,"U.S. sports broadcaster misses payment to MLB team as it nears bankruptcy, sources say",Dietrich Knauth,2023-03-13 12:13:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VF7X5P2YI5NLZDWK322A2SRBIQ.jpg,"March 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. regional sports broadcaster has failed to make a scheduled payment to Major League Baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks, a sign that bankruptcy is near for the company that provides local television broadcasts for nearly half of MLB, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League teams, according to Reuters sources.
Diamond Sports, a Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI.O) subsidiary that operates the ""Bally Sports"" branded channels, said in a Friday statement that it missed a payment owed to the Diamondbacks but continues to pay broadcasting rights fees owed to other teams.
The broadcaster had said last month that it missed a $140 million payment owed to its lenders, which triggered a 30-day grace period on its debt agreements. The company said at the time that it would use the 30 days to pursue restructuring talks with creditors and other key stakeholders.
Sources familiar with the negotiations who asked remain anonymous to speak frankly expect those talks to lead to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing next week.

In a response to a Reuters request for comment on the possible bankruptcy, Diamond Sports and MLB have both said that the company's financial constraints will not impact broadcasts for the baseball season that opens March 30. MLB has staffed up a new local broadcast division to provide replacement broadcasts if necessary, according to an MLB spokesman.
But MLB's contingency planning for broadcasting games would not replace payments owed by Diamond Sports to the 14 MLB teams who rely on revenue from local TV broadcast deals.
The missed payment amounts to $31 million, according to a source familiar with the matter, which would represent a significant chunk of the Diamondbacks' payroll.
The Diamondbacks declined to comment on the missed payment and its impact on the team's finances.
A bankruptcy filing would not immediately interrupt the broadcasting agreements, but could provide Diamond with leverage to renegotiate or terminate the contracts in bankruptcy court.
Diamond owes more than $1 billion in baseball broadcasting fees in 2023, according to a source familiar with the matter. The company also owns the rights to local broadcasts for the Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds, and Minnesota Twins, among others.
Regional sports broadcasts were once seen as a prized offering in cable TV packages, but consumer cord-cutting has made the business model less sustainable.

LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, the filmmakers who brought to life the off-kilter action-adventure movie ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" won the Academy Award on Sunday for best director.
It was the first Oscar for Kwan and Scheinert, who became friends in college and are known professionally as the Daniels.
The pair broke movie conventions with ""Everything Everywhere,"" spinning a chaotic tale about a stressed-out laundromat owner, her increasingly distant family and a frumpy tax agent across a multiple dimensions.
One universe featured people with hot dogs for fingers. Another portrayed mother and daughter conversing as rocks. Plastic googly eyes and a giant bagel also play major roles.
The characters battle through various scenarios in scenes inspired by kung fu movies, with the fate of the multiverse hinging on their actions.
Kwan and Scheinert said they wanted to surprise audiences as they told a drama about a Chinese American family and make people think about modern-day living with seemingly infinite information and choices.

The pair's previous project, 2016 film ""Swiss Army Man,"" also was unorthodox. It starred Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe as a farting corpse, the only companion for a man stranded on a deserted island.
Prior to their movie careers, Kwan and Scheinert, both 35, directed music videos for artists including DJ Snake and Jack Johnson.
On Sunday, the duo beat celebrated filmmaker Steven Spielberg, ""Banshees of Inisherin"" director Martin McDonagh and others who were nominated for the directing prize.

Lifestyle,/lifestyle/oscar-host-jimmy-kimmel-hails-movie-going-rebound-cracks-wise-about-the-slap-2023-03-13/,"Oscar host Jimmy Kimmel hails movie-going rebound, cracks wise about 'the slap'",Steve Gorman,2023-03-13 04:33:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/IWUWMLUZCFJBXNBRLUZD4GPPUY.jpg,"LOS ANGELES, March 12 (Reuters) - Comedian Jimmy Kimmel, hosting the Oscars for a third time, led a back-to-basics show on Sunday that celebrated a moviegoing rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic while avoiding - and making light of - the kind of ugly outburst that marred the 2022 telecast.
Kimmel opened the 95th Academy Awards with a monologue that jokingly admonished the stars filling the Dolby Theatre to behave, a year after Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage but was allowed to remain in the venue to accept the award for best actor minutes later.
""We know this is a special night for you,"" Kimmel told the crowd of Hollywood luminaries. ""We want you to have fun, we want you to feel safe, and, most important, we want me to feel safe.""
Kimmel, who was cheekily promoted ahead of Sunday's telecast as an ""unflappable and unslappable"" Oscars host, then went on to give a mock recitation of ""strict policies in place"" to prevent a repeat of last year's incident.
View 2 more stories 
""If anyone in this theater commits an act of violence at any point during this show, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute speech,"" he deadpanned to hearty but somewhat awkward laughter.
""If anything unpredictable or violent happens during the ceremony, just sit there and do what you did last year, nothing,"" Kimmel added. ""Maybe even give the assailant a hug.""
As punishment for his behavior, Smith was later banned from attending the ceremony for 10 years.
Later on, when introducing presenters for the documentary feature award, Kimmel reminded viewers Rock was presenting the award for that category when a joke he made about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, prompted Smith's assault.
The unprecedented altercation during a live awards show so unnerved the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that the group created a special ""crisis team"" designed to respond to any such mishaps. There were none.
Otherwise, Kimmel presided over a telecast dedicated largely to hailing the return of film fans to theaters, following a long estrangement from the multiplex that many in the industry worried might never be broken once streaming services took hold during the pandemic.
The theme was bolstered by the fact that several of the evening's nominated films were also among 2022's biggest box office hits, including ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Avatar: The Way of Water,"" ""Elvis,"" and ""Everything Everywhere All at Once,"" the last of which won seven Oscars, including best picture. It was a departure from many years in which relatively little-seen, but critically acclaimed, films have dominated the Academy Awards.
Kimmel seized on the power of popular films in his own grand entrance on Sunday, appearing to parachute to the Oscar stage following a real-life Hollywood flyover by two U.S. fighter jets shown at the very top of the telecast in an obvious nod to ""Top Gun,"" which the host later saluted as ""the movie that saved the movies.""
The late-night ABC television comedian repeatedly mocked the Oscars' notorious history of exceeding its designated three-hour running time, joking at one point that the hour of sleep Americans lost on Sunday as the U.S. reverted to daylight saving time was added into the Academy Awards telecast.
Among highlights of producers' bid to reinvigorate the show's roots as a forum for big-moment musical numbers, the telecast featured recording stars Lady Gaga and Rihanna singing two of the best original song nominees - ""Hold My Hand"" from ""Top Gun"" and ""Lift Me Up"" from ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."" The cast of the Indian superhero-like spectacle ""RRR"" performed that movie's winning best song ""Naatu Naatu"" with a rousing dance number.
The telecast was notable for a number of sight gags that drew major laughs - including two appearances by an unknown performer in costume making a faux impersonation of the furry title character from the popular wildlife thriller ""Cocaine Bear.""
Earlier, an actual donkey wearing an ""emotional support"" vest was led on stage by Kimmel and introduced to the audience as Jenny, the mini-donkey from the best picture contender ""The Banshees of Inisherin.""
The ABC telecast ran about 3-1/2 hours, prompting Kimmel to joke in the show's closing seconds, ""Sorry we ran a little long"" and telling viewers to stay tuned for the network's ""Good Morning America"" program, ""already in progress.""
Kimmel previously hosted in 2017, the year of the ""Moonlight"" best-picture mixup, and in 2018, the first Oscars of the #MeToo era.
In a final gag of the night, he stepped up to a sign that read: ""Number of Oscar shows without incident,"" and replaced a placard marked ""0"" with a ""1.""

It is the first German-language adaptation of a 1928 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, which was also made into a best picture-winning film in 1930.
""All Quiet on the Western Front"" tells a story of a young man who, poisoned by right-wing political nationalist propaganda, goes to war thinking it's an adventure, and war is anything but an adventure,"" producer Malte Grunert said in his acceptance speech for best film at the BAFTA awards last month.
The film ""is in fascinating dialogue with not just its source material, but the long history of warfare and cinema about war and atrocities,"" Sight & Sound wrote in its review, saying the film also owed a debt to films like ""1917,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down.""

Legal,/legal/north-carolinas-top-court-hear-redistricting-case-with-national-implications-2023-03-14/,North Carolina's top court to hear redistricting case with national implications,Joseph Ax,2023-03-14 10:34:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/ZPZCVJVWVZIVDHS4FFQARA3MLI.jpg,"March 14 (Reuters) - The new conservative majority on North Carolina's top court will consider on Tuesday whether to overturn the court's decision last year outlawing partisan redistricting, a move that would boost Republicans ahead of the 2024 congressional elections.
A reversal could be a mixed bag for Republicans, however. After the North Carolina Supreme Court decided last month to revisit the issue, the U.S. Supreme Court signaled it may sidestep a ruling in a related case in which Republicans have asked the justices to grant state legislatures sweeping new powers over federal elections.
The North Carolina Supreme Court's then-Democratic majority threw out a Republican-drawn congressional map last year, ruling the state constitution does not permit lawmakers to manipulate district lines for partisan advantage, a process known as gerrymandering.
As a result, November's midterm elections took place under a court-approved map, and Democrats and Republicans split the state's 14 congressional seats evenly.
View 2 more stories 
But Republican candidates flipped two of the court's seats, giving conservatives a 5-2 majority. The new court agreed along party lines to rehear the redistricting case, as well as a case in which the previous Democratic majority struck down a Republican-backed voter identification law.
Legal experts say the decision to rehear the cases suggests the new majority is prepared to reverse the court's prior rulings. A Republican-drawn congressional map would likely give the party three or four additional seats, helping to bolster a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House of Representatives next year.
""I think most folks who are watching this, myself included, would not be surprised or stunned if the decisions go in a partisan direction,"" said Michael Bitzer, a professor at Catawba College and the author of a book about the state's history of redistricting.
In court filings, Republican lawmakers argue that redistricting is inherently political and should be left to legislators, rather than judges. Good government groups, including Common Cause, have countered that gerrymandering harms democracy and that the court should not reverse rulings just because its partisan composition changed.
Last year's redistricting decision also prompted North Carolina Republicans to turn to the U.S. Supreme Court in what has become a high-profile case.
The Republicans urged the U.S. Supreme Court to adopt a contentious legal theory, the independent state legislature doctrine, that would prevent state courts from reviewing lawmakers' actions regarding federal elections, giving legislators unfettered authority over voting rules and redistricting.
Democrats have warned that doing so would invite a flood of new restrictions that would threaten fair elections, while Republicans say it would corral activist state courts that are undermining legislative power.
The Supreme Court's conservative justices appeared sympathetic to the Republicans' argument during oral arguments in December. But after the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision to rehear the case, the U.S. Supreme Court asked the various parties in the case to weigh in on whether the court still has jurisdiction over the matter.
If the justices decide they no longer have jurisdiction, they could dismiss the case without issuing a ruling.

Legal,/legal/biden-reinforce-background-checks-gun-buyers-2023-03-14/,Biden to reinforce background checks for gun buyers,Daniel Trotta,2023-03-14 12:13:00+00:00,,"March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden will announce an executive order on Tuesday that reinforces background checks for gun buyers in what the White House is promoting as the most comprehensive policy the president can enact without Congress.
The order will also strengthen federal support for red flag laws intended to stop gun sales to people deemed dangerous that have been passed by 19 states and the District of Columbia. It follows previous executive action the Biden administration has taken with the intent to reduce gun violence.
Other aspects of Biden's order would encourage the safe storage of guns and ask the Federal Trade Commission to analyze how gun manufacturers market firearms, including to minors, a senior administration official told reporters on Monday.
Biden plans to discuss the order on Tuesday, the White House said, when he will meet with gun violence victims in Monterey Park, California, where a shooter opened fire in a dance hall on Jan. 21, killing 11 people and injuring nine others.

In a country with more than 40,000 gun deaths per year, Biden is betting that voters will embrace more proactive gun control. Republican hopefuls who might seek their party's nomination to challenge the Democrat Biden in 2024 are certain to favor more expansive gun rights, backed by influential groups such as the National Rifle Association.
The Biden administration is pointing to public opinion polls that show a majority of Americans support background checks.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll last year found 84% of respondents supported background checks for all firearms sales and 70% backed red flag laws. That survey was taken immediately after a gunman opened fired at a school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 students and two teachers.
Some gun rights advocates oppose background checks, saying they infringe on constitutional rights to possess arms while failing to stop criminals from getting them. They also contend many red flag laws trample on due process rights.
Biden's order also proposes that the federal government respond to mass shootings in a coordinated fashion, similar to the way Washington reacts to a natural disaster, the senior aide said. Biden has asked his cabinet to develop a federal response that would provide trauma counseling or financial assistance, for example, to a community upended by a mass shooting.
But the heart of the executive order would seek to expand background checks intended to prevent felons or domestic abusers from buying guns, largely by leaning on federally licensed gun dealers to comply or educating others who may not realize they are required to run background checks under existing law, the White House said.
The president last year signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun control legislation in 30 years.
But since then the Republicans won control of the House of Representatives, ending virtually any chance of more gun legislation for the next two years, such as Biden's proposed bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Legal,/legal/litigation/,"CERAWEEK-US tax credits for low carbon aviation fuel need longer life, companies say",Stephanie Kelly,2023-03-10 22:31:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7MGROE4PGROODFRO5AXSXPUXI4.jpg,"HOUSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The five-year shelf life of U.S. tax credits for lower-carbon aviation fuel is too short to anchor development of the nascent industry, energy executives said this week in Houston.
President Joe Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) included major tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) that have stoked more interest in producing the fuel.
The credits would likely help spur some production and investment, but the industry would benefit if they lasted longer, the executives said.
Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as key to lowering aviation carbon emissions, one of the most difficult sectors of the economy to decarbonize because fuel for aircraft cannot be easily replaced.
The credits extend to 2027, but it would take much longer to scale up production of SAF to make it competitive with cheaper petroleum-based jet fuel.
""Having a policy that expires at that five-year mark really doesn't help,"" said LanzaJet Chief Executive Jimmy Samartzis.
View 2 more stories 
Though the IRA is a ""game-changer"" in supporting the SAF market, the tax credits are insufficient to make SAF competitive with traditional jet fuel, said Bryan Fisher, managing director at nonprofit RMI. RMI is focused on pushing federal and state policies to help support the SAF market, Fisher said.
President Joe Biden's administration has challenged the industry to supply at least 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030.
In 2022, oil refiners in the United States produced about 24.7 billion gallons of petroleum-based jet fuel, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed.
Devin Mogler, a senior vice president at Green Plains Inc (GPRE.O), said he expected the tax credit would be extended past 2027. New alliances were building within the energy and biofuels communities, as various players involved in the SAF, ethanol and biodiesel industries have a stake in seeing the market expand. They would be pushing for an extension for the credits, he said.
""The battle lines have really blurred politically on biofuels,"" Mogler told Reuters. ""There will be momentum to get it extended in some way, shape or form.""
Large incentives for the biofuels industry are not new - the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, enacted over a decade ago, established a multibillion-gallon market for the corn-based ethanol industry.
The new incentives around SAF, as well as the push to decarbonize road transportation and shift away from fossil fuels have prompted discussions around what is next for ethanol. Conversations at the CERAWeek energy conference focused around using ethanol as a feedstock for SAF.
Companies like Green Plains and LanzaJet are exploring how to scale up the ethanol-to-jet market. United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL.O) in January announced a new joint venture with Green Plains and energy infrastructure company Tallgrass to develop and commercialize an SAF technology that will use ethanol as a feedstock.
""Those ethanol producers who have spent the last 15-20 years developing out their infrastructure and their capacity want to seek another market that they can service,"" said LanzaJet's Samartzis.
Ethanol producers, however, need to leverage carbon capture and sequestration to reduce the carbon intensity of their ethanol, Samartzis added.

The jury in Salt Lake City reached its decision on Friday in ClearPlay's lawsuit against Dish, finding that Dish's AutoHop feature for skipping commercials on its Hopper set-top boxes is covered by ClearPlay's patents.
While jurors found that Dish's technology violated ClearPlay's patent rights, they rejected ClearPlay's contention that Dish copied its technology intentionally.
A Dish spokesperson said on Monday that the company was disappointed in the jury's decision and will contest the verdict, potentially through an appeal. Representatives for ClearPlay did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.

Salt Lake City-based ClearPlay's technology lets users filter out adult content like sex, violence and drug use from DVDs and streaming video. It sued Dish in 2014, alleging that AutoHop's technology for cutting commercials from DVR content violates its patents for a ""method of filtering multimedia content without altering the underlying video.""
Englewood, Colorado-based Dish said that AutoHop works differently from ClearPlay's patented technology. Dish also said the patents are invalid, arguing they are obvious based on earlier inventions or cover abstract ideas.

The once red-hot vaping company is currently facing thousands of lawsuits filed across the United States over claims on its marketing practices and for contributing to a rising tobacco use amongst youth.
In the settlement, Chicago said Juul has denied and continues to deny any wrongdoing and liability in connection with the design, manufacture, production, advertisement, marketing, distribution, sale, use, and performance of its products.
A Juul spokesman said in an emailed statement that the settlement with Chicago is another step in the company's ongoing commitment to resolve issues from the past and transition adult smokers away from combustible cigarettes while combating underage use of its products.

According to the settlement, the company has agreed to pay the city $2.8 million within 30 days of the execution of the agreement.
Chicago would receive an additional $21 million payment later this year under the current schedule and may potentially receive up to $750,000 additional, court-awarded payments, the Chicago mayor's office said.
Altria Group Inc (MO.N), which had a stake in Juul valued at $12.8 billion in 2018, on Monday exchanged its investment in Juul, last valued at $250 million, for some of the vaping company's heated tobacco intellectual property.
Altria said it would buy startup NJOY Holdings Inc for about $2.75 billion in cash, betting that NJOY will prove to be an easier way to tap the e-cigarette category since six of the company's products have received full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Meta will have to face a trial over accusations that it took Neural Magic's ""breakthrough"" algorithms that enable AI systems to process information more quickly, U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said.
The court also allowed testimony from an expert who said Meta owes Neural Magic as much as $766 million in royalties.
Representatives for Meta and Neural Magic did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. The trial is currently set to begin in September.
Somerville, Massachusetts-based Neural Magic was founded by two former Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers. Its investors include venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, VMware, Comcast and Verizon, according to its website.

Neural Magic sued Meta, then known as Facebook, in 2020 for allegedly stealing algorithms that enable simpler computers to run complex mathematical calculations more efficiently and allow research scientists to use larger data sets.
The lawsuit said Meta hired away a Neural Magic computer scientist, Aleksandar Zlateski, who gave the social-media giant the algorithms that make up the ""heart"" of Neural Magic's technology.
Neural Magic said Meta published the algorithms on open-source website GitHub and thanked Zlateski for solving a ""key problem for Facebook's continued advancement in the world of artificial intelligence.""
Meta asked the court to throw out the case last year, arguing Neural Magic had failed to identify any protectable trade secrets and that Zlateski had not acquired the information improperly. But the court on Monday allowed Neural Magic's case to continue for all but one of the 41 secrets it accused Meta of misappropriating.
Casper granted parts of Meta and Zlateski's request, rejecting Neural Magic's claims that they violated a non-competition clause or engaged in unfair business practices under Massachusetts law.

In a complaint filed in Cleveland federal court, the Department of Justice said Rite Aid repeatedly filled prescriptions from May 2014 to June 2019 that were medically unnecessary, for off-label use, or not issued in the usual course of professional practice.
""The Justice Department is using every tool at our disposal to confront the opioid epidemic that is killing Americans and shattering communities across the country,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.
Rite Aid pharmacists were accused of ignoring obvious signs of misuse, including in prescriptions for ""trinities,"" a combination of opioids, benzodiazepine, and muscle relaxants preferred by drug abusers for their increased euphoric effect.

Rite Aid is one of the country's largest pharmacy chains, with more than 2,330 stores in 17 U.S. states. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Justice Department accused Rite Aid of violating the federal False Claims Act by submitting false prescription claims to government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
It joined a whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2019 by two pharmacists and a pharmacy technician from Rite Aid stores in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and West Virginia.

Jefferies analysts said quarterly pretax profit missed expectations by 5%, and full-year earnings were also below consensus, despite jumping 50% - mostly due to the inclusion of the carmaker's Chinese joint venture.
Deliveries rose just over 10% in the quarter as an easing of chip supply problems offset the impact of lockdowns in China, while group revenue climbed 28% to 142.6 billion euros ($150.7 billion), versus a Refinitiv SmartEstimate of 141.6 billion.
The company also said it was promoting Walter Mertl to chief financial officer to replace Nicolas Peter when he retires in May.
BMW, which is due to report full annual results on March 15, warned late last year that although it expected improved sales in the fourth quarter, rising inflation and interest rates would start to weigh on demand, particularly in Europe.
The carmaker has so far weathered supply chain troubles brought on by the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in part by raising prices.

It proposed a dividend to shareholders of 8.50 euros, up from 5.80 a year earlier.
BMW said last February it would pay 3.7 billion euros to take majority control of BBA after securing the necessary licence from Beijing, increasing its stake to 75% from 50%.

Nasser was speaking to the press after the Saudi Arabian oil giant reported its highest ever annual profit since the company was listed. Aramco's shares traded 0.6% higher after the results were released, but closed mostly flat at 32.8 riyals ($8.74) a share.
He said spare capacity remained tight at 2 million barrels per day, while demand for jet fuel was increasing alongside China's re-opening from tight COVID-19 restrictions.
""If you considered China opening up and a pick up in jet fuels and very limited spare capacity, we are talking 2 million barrels, so as I said we are cautiously optimistic in the short to midterm and the market will remain tightly balanced,"" he said.

A deal agreed between Iran and Saudi Arabia on Friday to re-establish relations after years of hostility that had threatened stability and security in the Gulf would have a positive effect on global energy markets as it promotes regional stability, Nasser said.
The kingdom has blamed Iran for missile and drone attacks on its oil facilities in 2019 as well as attacks on tankers in Gulf waters. Iran has denied those charges.
Aramco's crude supplies to its main Asian customers, including China and India, were not impacted by the uptick of Russian sales into Asia on the back of Western sanctions.
""We have a track record of maintaining reliability and an excellent customer base. It didn't impact our supply to these main markets,"" he said.
On recent imports of Russian diesel into Saudi Arabia, Nasser said the kingdom had always been importing products for its domestic market since before the Russian-Ukraine conflict.
Nasser said Aramco was looking globally at liquefied natural gas (LNG) market opportunities, when asked about potential acquisitions in the year ahead.
The company is in ""active talks and discussions"" in terms of LNG investments, he said without elaborating.
Nasser cautioned that he still did not see enough investment to sustain demand in the long term going into the sector, saying that supply wouldn't be adequate in the mid- to long term if that trend continued.
""We need to make sure that there is additional supply in the market otherwise this tightness of supply in the mid- to long term will have an impact.""

Sustainable Markets,/business/energy/,"CERAWEEK-Big Oil on hydrogen: forget the rainbow, just make it profitable",Stephanie Kelly,2023-03-09 02:10:00+00:00,,"HOUSTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Governments worldwide need to simplify rules around hydrogen supply to attract investment and scale it up to become competitive enough to substitute fossil fuel use in heavy industry, energy executives said this week.
Hydrogen as a potential alternative to natural gas, coal or oil burned in heavy industry or shipping is seen as key to reducing emissions in industries in which electrification is not practical. Hydrogen is often described by color and many in the industry call it a ""rainbow renewable"" but the most important color for executives at the conference was green -- as in cash.
Hydrogen can be made in many ways, some cleaner than others. Among methods that produce what is known as green hydrogen are electrolysis to split water into hydrogen and oxygen using power from renewables. Hydrogen can also be made from natural gas. When carbon emissions from the process are captured and stored, it is known as blue hydrogen.
The industry is still in a nascent stage and the fuel is relatively expensive to produce, so governments worldwide are seeking ways to facilitate rapid development to make it an economic alternative to fossil fuels in industry.
View 2 more stories 
Provisions in U.S. President Joe Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and legislation in the European Union have incentivized the development of hydrogen but need further clarification, and government mandates may be required to encourage industries such as steel and shipping to embrace hydrogen, energy industry executives said at the CERAWeek energy conference this week in Houston.
""The market for hydrogen and people's willingness to pay a premium for low-emissions fuels I think hasn't quite taken off yet,"" Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chief Executive Darren Woods said.
Though the IRA is incentivizing production of green and blue hydrogen, Woods said the associated costs are making it difficult for Exxon's partners to sell either into Europe and Asia.
Discussions and rules around classifying hydrogen made from renewable fuels or natural gas should be secondary to making the fuel affordable for consumers, said Colin Parfitt, vice president of Midstream for Chevron Corp.
""There is way too much conversation about if it is blue or green,"" Parfitt said. ""The challenge is how do you create hydrogen as a business.""
Transporting hydrogen is currently not commercially viable nor affordable for consumers, Parfitt said.
The technology for shipping hydrogen is still in early stages of development, said Chevron's vice president of hydrogen Austin Knight.
The most obvious and near-term demand for hydrogen is in industries that currently use so-called grey hydrogen that is produced from fossil fuels, Spanish energy producer Cepsa SA (CPF.GQ) Chief Executive Maarten Wetselaar told Reuters. Grey hydrogen is currently consumed by fertilizer, refining, and iron and steel units.
About 30-35% of the total energy system will need hydrogen to decarbonize, he said.
For industries such as shipping, government mandates are needed to make hydrogen cost competitive with cheaper petroleum-based fuel oil, Wetselaar said.
By 2030, Cepsa plans to produce 600,000 tons of green ammonia per year, produced using hydrogen made from renewable energy, for green marine fuel and begin green ammonia exports by 2027. Cepsa could begin selling green ammonia to ships by 2026, Wetselaar told Reuters.
Meanwhile, low-carbon hydrogen fuels used for transportation need more infrastructure, such as refueling stations, to support and scale the market, said Plug Power Chief Executive Andy Marsh.
Green hydrogen could quickly be brought to market with the right rules around production, said CEO John Ketchum of the world's top renewable power generator NextEra.
NextEra is working with the U.S. Treasury on rules that govern what can be considered green hydrogen, he said. The process is complicated by the variability of renewable power supply from wind and solar, he said.
If power from those sources dropped, then an electrolyzer producing hydrogen would need to switch to power from the grid, which may or may not be renewable, he added. If hydrogen producers could no longer classify hydrogen as green and had to switch off electrolyzers, the cost of producing the fuel would go up and make it uneconomical. The solution would be to offset the use of non-renewable power with carbon credits, he said.
Otherwise, ""we will have an out-of-the-money product,"" he said.
More regulation, certifications and standards are needed for handling hydrogen, along with supply contracts to access infrastructure and new ideas on transporting hydrogen, company officials said Wednesday.
""The IRA has not been fully implemented yet in the U.S., so after that contract terms and clear standards will have to be tackled,"" said Juancho Eekhout, vice president of business development at Sempra Infrastructure.
Further, the trade of hydrogen also has complexities that will need to be addressed, said Margaux Moore, head of the Energy Transition Research Group at Trafigura.
Depending on how hydrogen is produced, the fuel has different carbon intensity scores in different countries, she said.

Sustainable Markets,/business/energy/,Factbox: Europe's draft plan to cushion power price spikes,Kate Abnett,2023-03-14 09:06:00+00:00,,"BRUSSELS, March 14 (Reuters) - The European Union is set to propose legislation on Tuesday to encourage countries to use more long-term, fixed-price electricity contracts to help shield consumers from price spikes.
The European Commission pledged last year to reassess the electricity market rules after Russia cut gas supplies to Europe, leading to record-high energy prices and supply concerns.
Here's what's in a draft of the EU proposal, seen by Reuters.
The aim is to leave consumers less exposed to short-term swings in fossil fuel prices and ensure increased low-cost renewable electricity generation translates into lower bills.
Countries should do that by using more long-term contracts that lock in fixed prices, according to the draft rules.
If EU countries support new investments in wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and nuclear electricity, for example, they would have to use a two-way contract for difference (CfD).
View 2 more stories 
Two-way CfDs offer generators a fixed ""strike price"" for their electricity, regardless of the price in short-term energy markets. If high market prices mean the generator receives extra revenue, those proceeds would be shared among consumers.
Countries should also support power purchase agreements - another type of long-term contract to directly buy electricity from a generator - such as by providing state guarantees. Fossil fuel-powered generators would not receive this support.
The proposal would also form virtual hubs that pool trading on forward electricity contracts in a large region - potentially multiple countries - under a hub-wide reference price. The hope is that if forward markets are more liquid, suppliers will use them to hedge their long-term price exposure, reducing their reliance on short-term price fluctuations.
The draft proposal would strengthen protections for consumers. For the first time, all EU countries would be obliged to protect vulnerable consumers from being cut off by electricity suppliers if they cannot pay their bills.
Billpayers would also gain the right to request a fixed-price contract from any large electricity supplier, to help them to avoid tariffs tied to volatile energy markets. Currently, EU consumers only have the legal right to request a variable price contract.
If energy prices spike to extreme levels, governments would also be able to temporarily fix the price of up to 80% of consumers' and small businesses' electricity consumption, to tame their bills.
Europe is attempting to integrate a growing share of renewable energy into its electricity system and shift away from fossil fuels.
The draft rules would allow power network operators to pay market participants to use less electricity or use stored power during periods of peak demand - schemes known as ""peak-shaving products"".
Countries would also set targets for energy storage and demand side flexibility - where consumers get paid to adjust their use to help balance the grid. The aim is to gradually replace the role that gas power plants currently play in balancing power supply.
The proposal is unlikely to please all EU countries, who disagree on how much reform is needed. EU countries and the European Parliament will negotiate and approve the reforms - a process that could take more than a year.
Spain, France and Greece are among those seeking deeper reform to how power prices are set. Currently, power prices in Europe are set by the running cost of the final power plant needed to meet overall demand. Often, that is a gas plant, so gas price spikes can send electricity prices soaring.
But the draft document suggests the Commission has chosen a route preferred by Germany, Denmark, Latvia and others who want to keep the price-setting system and make more limited tweaks.
They say Europe's existing power market has fostered years of lower power prices and helped avoid energy shortages - and that drastic change could scare off investors, putting at risk the hundreds of billions of euros in renewable energy investments Europe needs to meet its climate goals.

Exploration & Production,/business/energy/,CERAWEEK-OPEC does not need to make up for Russia oil output cut -Angola oil minister,Stephanie Kelly,2023-03-08 23:56:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/MZY72EWEO5LI3MJGYALZD67MUY.jpg,"HOUSTON, March 8 (Reuters) - There is no need for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase oil output to make up for Russia's 500,000 barrel per day cut, Angola's secretary of state for oil and gas told Reuters on Wednesday.
""We believe the Russian oil is still there,"" Angola's Jose Barroso said on the sidelines of an energy conference in Houston. ""They find a way, they find new markets... There is a balance in the market.""
Russia said it would cut 500,000 bpd of supply from March. The Group of Seven countries, the European Union and Australia implemented the price cap on seaborne cargoes of Russian oil on Dec. 5, setting it at $60 a barrel.
Russian oil has found buyers in countries such as China and India that have not imposed sanctions.
If China is importing more oil from Russia, then perhaps it is importing less from other countries, Barroso said.
View 2 more stories 
""We believe for the time being there is no need for the OPEC member countries to increase their production,"" he added.
Barroso could not say whether Angola was losing market share in China to Russia, adding he lacks data on that. Energy demand in China is rising as Beijing loosens coronavirus restrictions.
Asked whether Angola would favor an increase in OPEC output quotas if it could produce more, Barroso said the country has a long way to go before reaching its current quota.
OPEC and allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to cut their output target by 2 million barrels per day from last November through 2023. As part of this, the 10 OPEC members bound by the deal have a target to produce 25.416 million bpd.
Angola's output was 1.050 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, and its OPEC target was 1.455 million bpd. OPEC output is significantly undershooting targeted amounts because many producers - notably Nigeria and Angola - lack the capacity to pump at the agreed levels.
U.S. energy envoy Amos Hochstein said this week during the CERAWeek conference that the price cap - designed to reduce Russian revenues without slowing its exports - was working well, as Russian oil was still finding its way to market.
OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais said on Tuesday that he was not concerned about the rerouting of Russian crude exports to countries such as China and India.

Exploration & Production,/business/energy/,Equinor makes Norway oil and gas discovery,Reuters,2023-03-14 07:55:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/NULMQOA5JVIVPDCC5DEFR4T7VI.jpg,"COPENHAGEN, March 14 (Reuters) - Equinor (EQNR.OL) has made an oil and gas discovery near the Troll field in the North Sea, believed to contain between 24 million and 84 million barrels of oil equivalent, the company said on Tuesday.
The discovery, which contains slightly more oil than gas, is commercially interesting, partly because it can use existing infrastructure connected to the company's floating processing and accommodation platform Troll B, Equinor said.
However, an appraisal well is needed to estimate the size of the find and the volumes that can be recovered more precisely, it added.
Named Heisenberg, the find is Equinor's eight discovery in the Troll field area since 2019.
Equinor holds a 51% stake in the licence while DNO holds 49%, according to Norway's Petroleum Directorate.

Regulatory Oversight,/business/energy/,Wave of new LNG export plants threatens to knock gas prices,Liz Hampton,2023-03-14 10:10:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/J5IMFH7SAZOM3JCUWLNQ2V4RFA.jpg,"HOUSTON, March 14 - A flood of liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects due online worldwide in mid-decade will vie against lower-cost renewable energy and a revived nuclear power sector, which could rock gas prices and hurt some proposed projects, analysts say.
Proposed and approved new LNG plants would boost LNG supply by 67% increase to 636 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) by 2030 from 2021 levels, potentially saturating the gas market.
""There's over a trillion dollars of natural gas infrastructure being built in the world today. There's a set secular shift and natural gas that is here to stay,"" said Jack Fusco, CEO of LNG exporter Cheniere Energy at a conference in Houston last week.
In Qatar, a massive LNG expansion project will add 49 mtpa by 2027. U.S. projects could add 125 mtpa (16.4 billion cubic feet per day) of capacity by late 2027, according to data compiled by BTU Analytics, a FactSet company.

In a taste of the potential volatility those projects might face, LNG prices last year soared on European demand, then slid as storage filled and customers pushed back against the high prices and switched to other energy sources.
That shift is only going to accelerate. In 2021 alone, wind and solar's share of global power generation jumped to more than 10% from just 1% a year earlier, climate think tank Ember estimates.
At the same time, nuclear is rebounding: Japan aims to boost nuclear's share of its power to at least 20% by 2030 from less than 7% last year. France is proposing to build six nuclear reactors by 2035.
Analysts see LNG prices remaining strong until around 2027, but after that they may fall as the demand outlook is hazy.
""One big uncertainty the industry is focused on is how much damage the high prices has done to medium term gas demand,"" said Michael Stoppard, who leads global gas strategy at S&P Global.
S&P Global pushed back its demand growth outlook for LNG from emerging markets by two years due to the spike in prices.
LNG has ""acquired a reputation as a costly and unreliable fuel"" that could jeopardize plans to build new import terminals in Asia, the region with the highest demand outlook, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in a report last month.
China cut its LNG purchases by 20% last year on COVID-19 curbs and price volatility. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh also slashed combined LNG purchases by 16% last year, IEEFA said.
In the U.S., gas markets saw a volatile start to the year after a relatively mild northern hemisphere winter and higher LNG prices which led to conservation sent U.S. prices below the cost of new production and led to a retrenchment in drilling.
Muqsit Ashraf, who leads Accenture Strategy, expects solid demand to support LNG prices through around 2027.
""What happens after that is more of a debate and depends on how investment decisions play out this year,"" said Ashraf, who previously headed Accenture's global energy practice.
Baker Hughes (BKR.O), a major LNG equipment supplier, warned in January that cost inflation and higher interest rates had slowed the pace of LNG final investment decisions.
Still, it anticipates ""significant growth"" in project approvals this year. The year's first came on Monday, with Venture Global LNG authorizing the second-phase of its 20 mtpa Plaquemines LNG project.
The risk is projects will come on line just as demand growth slows and hit global LNG prices.
""When you hear people say 'there is no way we will overbuild this,' that's when things get over-built,"" said Alan Armstrong, CEO of U.S. gas pipeline operator Williams Companies which supplies gas to LNG exporters.

Wind,/business/energy/,"CERAWEEK-Renewable energy investors squeezed by higher interest rates, costs",Isla Binnie,2023-03-10 17:46:00+00:00,,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON, March 10 (Reuters) - Corporations and investors have been pouring money into renewable energy projects, seeing an opportunity to grasp the Holy Grail of socially conscious investing: do good while doing well.
But sharply higher interest rates have further stressed a model strained by soaring prices for steel and silicon, vital for wind turbines and solar panels.
Higher costs have buyers and sellers of renewable power projects recalculating potential returns, hampering fundraising and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).
For years, the cleantech revolution has attracted big bucks, echoing investment booms that benefited from the zeitgeist around organic food, shale oil and gas, and sustainable fishing ventures.
""I think of the most recent years in the power space and renewables specifically a bit like the shale boom in 2008-2010,"" said Bernadette Johnson, head of power and renewables at analytics firm Enverus.
A decade of low interest rates meant borrowers could raise cheap debt to build projects and juice returns. But an era of plentiful materials and financing has given way to constraints.

With the U.S. Federal Reserve projected to raise headline rates to around 5.5% this year and European hawks starting to posit peak rates above 4%, returns are squeezed.
""Some people are starting to lose money. Others are definitely making money but it's evolving,"" Johnson said.
Even with President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and potential state support in Europe, private equity investment in alternative energy including battery and energy conservation technology is heading for the slowest quarter since 2020, according to Refinitiv data.
Refinitiv also projects the value of M&A this quarter will total $5.6 billion, from $17.7 billion last and almost in line with the depths of COVID total between April and June 2020.
Utilities in the U.S. and Europe have been selling parts of their renewables businesses to fund network upgrades without offering new equity or damaging credit ratings through debt sales.
Consolidated Edison (ED.N) sold its U.S. renewables business to Germany's RWE (RWEG.DE) for $6.8 billion in October. Since then, similar moves have struggled against the new market reality.
Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) said last month a divestment of its renewables business, which it valued in November at $4 billion, was taking longer than expected.
Financial investors traditionally took stakes in operating renewables projects to avoid risks of construction delays and ensure stable returns.
As competition heated up in recent years, projects started being sold earlier, pre-construction.
That construction now costs substantially more.
""Having seen inflation and the cost of debt go higher, in many cases there has been a need to go back and recut the economics,"" said Adi Blum, a managing director at BlackRock (BLK.N), told a CERAWeek panel.
Germany's PNE AG (PNEGn.DE) could explore selling its U.S. solar and wind business due to high project costs, sources told Reuters this week, hoping IRA tax credits could attract suitors.
One other consideration is older plants are starting to show signs of wear, requiring costly repairs or upgrades.
""The pool of operators or investors out there who can handle those changes and generate improvements is much smaller than you think,"" said Angelo Acconcia, partner at investment firm ArcLight Capital Partners.
""We came out of a cycle of low interest rates in which it was easy to look for an asset, buy, build, de-risk and sell cash flows. Now the transactions we are seeing are for growth, they are not based so much on cashflows,"" said Oscar Perez, investment director at fund manager Qualitas Energy.

Renewable Fuels,/business/energy/,Exclusive: Hydrogen firm Thyssenkrupp Nucera says IRA spurring U.S. interest,Christoph Steitz,2023-03-09 12:34:00+00:00,,"FRANKFURT, March 9 (Reuters) - German hydrogen firm Thyssenkrupp Nucera (TKAG.DE) has seen customer interest soar in the U.S. as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and may create local production capacity with Italy's De Nora (DNR.MI) if the market takes off.
Thyssenkrupp Nucera held talks about several potential green hydrogen projects ""with very concrete timelines"" during a trip to the United States last week, Chief Executive Werner Ponikwar said in an interview.
Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, is seen as key to decarbonising industry and so meeting climate targets.
Nucera is reviewing how the IRA, which offers incentives for clean energy initiatives, could help subsidise investments in production capacity, research facilities and pilot projects in the U.S. market, said Ponikwar, who joined the IPO candidate from industrial gases group Linde (LIN.N) last year.
View 2 more stories 
Ponikwar's comments add to a growing number of European companies considering a bigger U.S. presence because of the favourable framework the IRA provides, including Audi VOWG_p.DE, Schaeffler (SHA_p.DE) and Northvolt.
""We are gaining a new growth market,"" Ponikwar said. ""Interest in our electrolysers has increased noticeably and significantly.""
Governments worldwide need to simplify rules around hydrogen supply to attract investment and scale it up to become competitive enough to substitute fossil fuel use in heavy industry, energy executives said this week.
Ponikwar expects the U.S. hydrogen market to grow to a mid double-digit gigawatt (GW) amount by the end of the decade, from just a few hundred megawatts currently.
Legislative specifics of the IRA regarding hydrogen are still being hammered out, Ponikwar said, adding that most of the projects under discussions would likely not get a final investment decision before that happens.
Thyssenkrupp Nucera already has a U.S. presence in Houston, Texas, which mostly services customers of its chlor-alkali technologies. It is working closely with co-owner De Nora, which has a production site in the United States, Ponikwar said.
""We will think about creating manufacturing capacities together with De Nora in the USA if the market grows as strongly as expected,"" he said.
Nucera, a 66-34 joint venture between Thyssenkrupp and De Nora, is already in a strategic partnership with U.S.-based Air Products (APD.N) and has won an order for a U.S. hydrogen plant from CF Industries (CF.N).
The Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, a key component of the IRA, provides a 10-year federal tax credit of up to $3 per kilogram for clean hydrogen produced after 2022 from facilities that begin construction prior to 2033. That has the potential to push projects into profit that would otherwise be loss-making.
Nucera engineers electrolysers that are needed to produce green hydrogen, a field where it competes with Norway's Nel (NEL.OL), Britain's ITM Power (ITM.L), France's McPhy Energy (MCPHY.PA) and U.S. company Plug Power (PLUG.O).
It focuses on so-called alkaline water electrolysis, which Credit Suisse reckons will account for 60% of the global market by 2030 as it is more suitable for big projects, while proton exchange membrane electrolysis is seen at around a third.
While the IRA supports hydrogen production, it does not require makers of hydrogen equipment to produce locally, unlike other renewable technologies where that's a condition to qualify for credits.
Siemens Energy (ENR1n.DE), which is also active in hydrogen and currently ramping up production of electrolysis modules at its Berlin plant jointly owned with Air Liquide (AIRP.PA), said it could therefore already meet the eligibility criteria.
""From our production in Berlin, we can supply projects all over the world and then organise the assembly of the electrolysers through local partners on site,"" the company said in emailed comments.
""The IRA is a booster for the hydrogen economy in the U.S.,"" it said, adding the European Union's Green Deal Industrial Plan, seen as a response to the IRA, should create similar conditions for the hydrogen sector in Europe.
Nucera's Ponikwar agreed, while noting that Europe's tendency towards bureaucracy could slow progress there.
""In the U.S., people are more pragmatic. And as far as regulation is concerned, it is also somewhat less detailed than in Europe.""

Shareholder Activism,/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/,Carl Icahn prepares for proxy fight at Illumina - WSJ,Reuters,2023-03-13 02:22:00+00:00,https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/FKA4GFPZHNOYVOYCH6VMMN4AXE.jpg,"March 12 (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn is preparing a proxy fight at Illumina Inc (ILMN.O), arguing that the life science maker's acquisition of Grail Inc (GRAL.O) cost its shareholders roughly $50 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
Illumina completed a takeover of cancer-detection test maker Grail in August 2021, without securing regulatory approval from the European Union. The European Commission ordered Illumina in December to unwind the deal, three months after it had blocked the merger on concerns the deal would stifle innovation.
Icahn plans to nominate three people to Illumina's board, the WSJ report said, citing a letter the billionaire plans to send to the shareholders on Monday.
""We are convinced that at least three shareholder representatives are needed on Illumina's board to attempt to put an end to this insanity now before the reckless decision making escalates into a no-return situation,"" Icahn wrote in the letter, according to the WSJ.

Icahn in the letter said his nominees - Vincent Intrieri, the founder and chief executive officer of an investment fund, and two of his deputies Jesse Lynn and Andrew Teno - would bring experience dealing with crises to the board.
Icahn wrote that he tried to strike a deal with Illumina to avoid a proxy battle.
Illumina declined to comment on the report while Carl Icahn did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Employee Benefits & Executive Compensation,/business/autos-transportation/,Caterpillar union workers vote in favor of six-year labor agreement,Bianca Flowers,2023-03-13 08:50:00+00:00,,"March 12 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union said members at four local chapters working at Caterpillar (CAT.N) had voted in favor of a new six-year labor contract with the firm, preventing a strike at the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment.
Unionized workers unanimously accepted the deal that outlined a 27% combined wage increase and lump sums over the six-year period, a bump in employer contributions to retirement plans, and a $6,000 bonus.
""The terms of the contract are effective immediately (March 13),"" UAW said in a statement on Sunday.
Additionally, the latest deal included a moratorium on plant closures after years of CAT shifting production to other U.S. facilities and shuttering its Aurora, Illinois factory in 2017.
The contract covers roughly 7,000 union workers at plants in central Illinois and a parts distribution center in York, Pennsylvania. In a notice seen by Reuters, 71.5% of union members voted to accept the tentative agreement. The union did not disclose how many workers voted.

Local union leaders at Caterpillar said in a statement they were pleased to have reached an agreement with management to avoid a strike such as those that the company's rivals Deere & Co. (DE.N) and CNH Industrial had gone through.
Rank and file union workers at the company have expressed anger and frustration over the deal, saying that wage increases weren't commensurate in the face of rising inflation.
But some members believe the new contract is the best CAT has offered in years, after they agreed to company concessions in previous deals that froze wages during the great recession.
""It's a decent contract and I just want it behind us at this point,"" a 40-year-old lathe operator who has worked at a Caterpillar plant in Peoria, Illinois since 2006 told Reuters. The operator was not authorized to speak to the media.
The UAW's contract ratification with Caterpillar comes just six months ahead of the deadline for the union and the three Detroit automakers concluding new master contracts covering roughly 143,000 workers.

The COVID vaccine maker said it will open new offices in California and Seattle, adding that its Genomics unit will expand to south San Francisco.
The latest move comes at a time when Moderna has been working on developing vaccines for skin cancer, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) using its mRNA technology, which if approved would significantly boost the biotech company that currently relies heavily on its COVID-19 shot.
Last month, Moderna forecast rising costs for 2023 and a decline in COVID vaccine sales, raising concerns that the company could post a loss this year.

Science,/lifestyle/science/,Relativity postpones Florida launch of 3D-printed Terran rocket,Joey Roulette,2023-03-09 11:06:00+00:00,,"March 8 (Reuters) - California-based startup Relativity Space called off the planned debut launch of its 3D-printed rocket in Florida on Wednesday over fuel temperature concerns, delaying a key test of the company's novel strategy for cutting manufacturing costs.
The 110-foot-tall (35-meter) Terran 1 rocket, 85% of which was fabricated from a 3D-printer, had been scheduled to lift off from a U.S. Space Force Base launch pad in Cape Canaveral on Wednesday afternoon. Dwindling ""propellant thermal conditions"" in the rocket's second stage during a three-hour launch window ultimately forced a scrub, the company said on Twitter.
The company said the rocket's next launch attempt is scheduled for Saturday in a window from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. EST (1800 to 2100 GMT).
Relativity, one of a handful of U.S. rocket startups competing to meet the growing demand for cheap launch services, has bet on the cost savings it expects to achieve using giant, robotic 3D-printers to simplify its rocket production lines.
Most of its rivals have focused on lowering costs by building rockets designed to be reuseable, such as the Falcon 9 boosters produced by Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The inaugural Terran 1 launch is intended to validate the company's supposition that its rocket's 3D-printed structure can withstand the forces of a launch off Earth.
""The launch that we're preparing for is an opportunity to demonstrate a whole bunch of things all at once,"" Josh Brost, Relativity's senior vice president of revenue, told Reuters ahead of the planned launch attempt.
Brost called the Terran 1 ""by far the largest 3D-printed structure that's ever been assembled.""

The 3D-printing process, widely used in various industries, involves machines that autonomously ""print"" sequential layers of soft, liquid or powdered materials that are quickly hardened or fused to form solid, three-dimensional objects. Designs of the objects are scanned from digital blueprints.
The use of 3D-printers, Brost said, allows Relativity to hasten much of its manufacturing processes and more easily make changes to improve the rocket's design if needed after it flies, eliminating the need for a complex supply chain that would otherwise slow down rocket enhancements.
""First launches of new rockets are notoriously prone to have different reasons that they need the scrub,"" Brost said. ""So it would not be at all unlikely for us to even need a couple of attempts to get through the countdown and lift off for our inaugural launch.""
While the expendable Terran 1 is built to carry 2,755 pounds (1,250 kg) of satellites to low-Earth orbit, waning demand for that class of launch vehicle has led Relativity to develop a larger, 3D-printed reusable rocket - the Terran R - that it expects to fly in 2024.
Currently driving demand are the so-called mega-constellation plans by companies such as SpaceX, OneWeb and Jeff Bezos' Amazon (AMZN.O) to deploy tens of thousands of internet-beaming satellites to low-Earth orbit in the next few years.
SpaceX flies its own heavy-lift rockets to get its Starlink network into orbit, while Amazon and OneWeb plan to use similar large rockets from various launch companies for their own satellites. OneWeb will launch its next-generation satellites on Relativity's Terran R, the companies announced last year.
Relativity has roughly $1.65 billion worth of launch contracts secured for both its rockets, with the bulk of that revenue attributable to the larger Terran R.
While market demand for rockets like Terran 1 has weakened, Brost said the rocket's upcoming flights will inform how Terran R is engineered.
Asked if Relativity is still selling Terran 1 to customers, Brost said the company ""continues to talk to people about both vehicles.""
